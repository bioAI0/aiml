EGFR is a well-known antigen that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The paper mentions that EGFR amplification is a genomic alteration found in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, which is associated with a worse prognosis.

The paper does not provide specific information about the expression levels of EGFR across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, EGFR is a widely studied target for cancer immunotherapy, and its expression levels can vary across different cancer types.

I did not find any other antigens that met your criteria in the provided text.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGR4
- PAPPA
- LRRC3
- ANXA3

These antigens were found to be significantly up-regulated in the TMZ-resistant group of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The expression level of these genes was also observed to be higher in recurrent GBMs and the TMZ-resistant sectors of the TMZ-ITH patients, suggesting their role in contributing to TMZ resistance.

The paper also mentions that the expression level of the four TMZ-resistant markers predicted poor survival not only in the study cohort but also in an independent IDH-wt GBM cohort extracted from the TCGA dataset. This indicates that these antigens could be potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

However, the paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
- Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression is downregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, which restricts antigen presentation and contributes to immune escape.
- Fas-ligand expression is increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, facilitating cell death in leukocytes.
- Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are immunosuppressive cytokines secreted by IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, suppressing immune response.
- The signaling pathway of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) tends to have mutations that occur more often in the IDH-wildtype glioblastoma of biological female patients.
- The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has genetic changes that occur more frequently in the helical domain for females and the kinase domain for males in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, demonstrating a sex preference for mutation location.

- TERT promoter mutations: Detectable in 56.3% of IDH wild-type patients, these mutations are associated with glioblastoma driver mutations.
- Nestin: A protein expressed in neural stem cells and glioblastoma stem cells, nestin is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation.
- CD133: A cell surface marker associated with cancer stem cells, CD133 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been linked to tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy.
- CD44: A cell adhesion molecule, CD44 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis.
- SOX2: A transcription factor involved in maintaining stem cell properties, SOX2 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been associated with tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and their potential role in tumor development and progression. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the molecular characteristics of glioblastoma, particularly in relation to the subventricular zone, for the development of targeted therapies.

Regarding their expression levels across different cancer types, the paper does not provide specific information. However, it is worth noting that these antigens are not exclusive to glioblastoma and may be expressed in other cancer types as well. For example, CD133 is a well-known marker for cancer stem cells in various solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer. Similarly, CD44 is widely expressed in many cancer types and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper does not provide direct information. However, the identification of these antigens and their association with glioblastoma stem cells could have implications for the development of targeted therapies. For instance, targeting these antigens with specific antibodies or small molecules could potentially inhibit the growth and spread of glioblastoma stem cells, leading to improved treatment outcomes. Additionally, the study's findings suggest that the subventricular zone, a region rich in neural stem cells, may play a crucial role in glioblastoma pathogenesis and resistance to therapy. This knowledge could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target the subventricular zone and its associated stem cell populations.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR
- MGMT
- ATRX
- p53
- Ki67

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as predictive markers for glioblastoma patient survival. The study also highlights the importance of considering the use of steroids for the symptomatic relief of glioblastoma patients, as steroids can influence immune cell activity and affect the expression of these antigens.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it is worth noting that the study focuses on glioblastoma, a specific type of brain tumor, and the expression of these antigens may vary in other cancer types.
- CD44: This antigen is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, and its expression is critical for GBM invasion and migration. Higher levels of CD44 have been associated with poor prognosis in GBM.
- GFAP: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a marker of astrocytic differentiation and is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Its expression is positively correlated with advancing neuroglial tumor grade.
- S100B: S100B is a calcium-binding protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It has been shown to promote glioma growth and increase myeloid-derived macrophage chemoattraction.
- GSK3β: This protein is part of the PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway and is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Its phosphorylation state plays a role in glycogen synthesis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell cycle regulation.
- Tau: Microtubule-associated protein tau is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with the resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cell lines. It has also been linked to glioblastoma progression, 3D cell organization, growth, and migration.

These antigens are not only highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma but also have implications for immunotherapy and tumor targeting. For example, CD44 has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in GBM, and S100B has been shown to promote glioma growth and increase myeloid-derived macrophage chemoattraction. Additionally, GSK3β and Tau have been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell signaling, gene expression, and cell growth and differentiation, which are critical for tumor development and immune response.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET)
- 6-[18F]-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine ([18F]FDOPA)

Regarding their expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that the use of [18F]FDG for PET imaging is widespread in nuclear medicine, but its clinical use in neuro-oncological diseases is limited due to the high physiological uptake of glucose in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, resulting in a poor tumor-to-background ratio. On the other hand, glioma cells have a distinctly increased nutritional demand for amino acids to enable rapid proliferation, and unlike glucose, normal brain tissue has a low physiological uptake of amino acids, providing a superior tumor-to-background contrast.

The paper also discusses the use of positron-emitting nuclide-labelled amino acids as interesting probes for imaging gliomas in the pre- and post-treatment setting using PET. The main amino acid tracers used for glioma imaging are [11C]MET, [18F]FET, and [18F]FDOPA, all of which are taken up by the cell from the extracellular space via the Na+-independent system L-type amino acid transporter.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper mentions that the combination of PET imaging and PWI has been suggested to further improve the overall diagnostic accuracy of the differentiation of TP from TRA. A stepwise approach, where PWI-MRI is used to select cases for which PET imaging is most useful, can also increase diagnostic accuracy. The combination of exactly which PWI and PET technique is most optimal is not known and should be determined by the level of local expertise. More prospective, blinded research is needed to investigate whether PET imaging indeed adds diagnostic value when PWI is inconclusive.
