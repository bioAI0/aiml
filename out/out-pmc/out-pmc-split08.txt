- **CD133:** CD1
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1): PD-L1 is a checkpoint protein that is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. It is a potential target for immunotherapy, as higher risk scores were significantly associated with upregulation of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1.
- CD276: CD276 is another immune checkpoint protein that is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is also associated with a poor prognosis, and its expression is significantly correlated with higher risk scores.
- CD44: CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. It is expressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma, and its expression is significantly correlated with higher risk scores in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is associated with a poor prognosis and a higher risk of recurrence compared to IDH-mutant glioblastoma.
- The study suggests that the developed prognostic model, based on risk scores, could be used as a potential biomarker for risk stratification and treatment response prediction in glioblastoma patients.
- The prognostic model was constructed using 10× scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data, and it effectively classified patients into high- and low-risk groups based on their risk scores.
- The study also explored the relationship between risk scores, TMB values, and PD-L1 expression levels, but found no significant correlation between higher risk scores and higher TMB values.

- SELP (P-selectin): Overexpressed and oversecreted by IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, SELP has been linked to increased metastasis and spreading of melanoma and colon cancer cells via PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) mediated platelet activation. Blocking SELP function has been shown to delay tumor growth, prolong survival, and improve immune infiltration in vivo.
- PSGL-1: While PSGL-1 is considered a T cell immune checkpoint, it has also been implicated in aiding the spreading and metastasis of melanoma and colon cancer cells via P-selectin-mediated platelet activation. In glioblastoma, cancer cells overexpress and oversecrete SELP to exploit PSGL-1 signaling in glioma-associated microglia/macrophages.
- PD1: PD1 is expressed on intratumoral myeloid cells in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its expression is correlated with the accumulation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) during cancer-driven emergency myelopoiesis. Myeloid cell-specific PD1 ablation has been shown to increase Tem cells and improve their functionality, mediating anti-tumor immunity despite perceived PD1 expression on T cells.
- CTLA-4: CTLA-4 is expressed on circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells in cancer patients, including glioblastoma, and is associated with advanced disease and a negative prognosis independent of disease stage. The increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules on circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells likely reflects the immunosuppressive network in glioblastoma patients.
- GITR: GITR expression is increased on circulating CD4+ T cells in glioblastoma patients, which is linked to increased frequencies of regulatory T cell subsets and underlines the immune dysregulation in these patients.
- 2-HG (2-hydroxyglutarate): The oncometabolite 2-HG is released in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and contributes to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
- CD163: CD163 is overexpressed in parenchymal microglia/macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its increased expression is paralleled by increased expression of PSGL-1.
- CD206: CD206 is upregulated in the anti-inflammatory/pro-tumorigenic activation of microglia/macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- CD276 (B7-H3): CD276 is a solid tumor-associated antigen that is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages.
- HLA-DR: HLA-DR is downregulated on circulating monocytes in glioblastoma patients, and its expression is influenced by steroid medication.
- CD169: CD169 is expressed on macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- CD273 (PDL2): CD273 is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

These antigens are not only highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma but also play a role in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and the regulation of immune responses. Some of these antigens, such as SELP, PSGL-1, PD1, and CTLA-4, have been targeted in immunotherapy approaches, while others, like 2-HG, CD163, CD206, and CD276, have been implicated in tumor progression and immune evasion.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- **Fibronectin 1 (FN1)**: FN1 is a prognostic risk factor and is significantly upregulated in GBM samples. It may play a role in GBM progression through ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.
- **HLA-DRA, CD44, SLC1A5, EGFR, ITGB2, PTPRJ**: These genes were found to be significantly upregulated in GBM. High expression of CD44, PTPRJ, and HLA-DRA was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival.
- **IL-13Ra2**: IL-13Ra2 is an interleukin receptor that is overexpressed in over 60% of GBM and 44.1% of gliomas. Clinical trials have found immunotherapies targeting the IL-13Ra2 receptor to be effective.
- **CD133/CD44**: CD133 is co-expressed with CD44 and linked to similar molecular features.
- **B7-H3**: B7-H3 is a marker for SVZ-GBM cells and its inhibition in GBM cells reduces their tumorigenicity. Out of the two B7-H3 isoforms, only 2IgB7-H3 was detected in non-cancerous brain tissue, whereas 4IgB7-H3 was specific to GBM. 2IgB7-H3 expression was higher in GBM recurrences and increased resistance to temozolomide-mediated apoptosis.
- IDH1 R132H: This marker is examined for reactivity (positive or negative) and the cytoplasmic intensity of the reaction (strong, moderate, or weak).
- Nestin: This marker is evaluated by the cytoplasmic immunoreaction (strong, moderate, or weak) of glial cells and reactivity (positive or negative) in endothelial cells. It is expressed in neural stem cells, cancer stem cells, and undifferentiated cancer cells. In some tumors, such as cerebral ones, its overexpression correlates with tumor grade and invasiveness and indicates cellular immaturity.
- Ki-67: The reference index for this marker is calculated as the percentage of positive nuclei after counting on 10 HPF of at least 1000 nuclei.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, and their expression levels are assessed using immunohistochemical methods. The study also discusses the importance of these antigens in the prognosis and survival of patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): FAP is a novel target for molecular-based PET imaging, which has shown promising results in various tumors, including glioblastoma. FAP is overexpressed in most glioblastomas, especially in the mesenchymal subtype, and is associated with FAP-positive vessels, foci of neoplastic cells, and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. The study found that 18F-FAPI PET/CT detected 69.6% of all lesions in glioblastoma patients, with a 100% positive predictive value. However, the study did not find any correlation between FAP expression and PET/CT parameters, and some lesions were not labeled with FAP on immunohistochemistry.

- Ki-67: Ki-67 is a marker of cell proliferation and is often used as a prognostic marker in glioblastoma. The study found that the Ki-67 index was not correlated with the FAPI-PET/CT parameters, such as MGMT promoter methylation, TERT, and IDH mutation. However, the study also noted that only one of the glioblastoma patients had IDH mutation, which may have limited the ability to detect correlations.

- IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.
- CD14 and CD64: These antigens are expressed at higher levels on microglia in IDH-wildtype GBM compared to IDH-mutant tumors.
- HLA-DR and MHC I/II: These antigens are expressed at higher levels on macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM compared to IDH-mutant tumors.
- CD163 and CX3CR1: These antigens are expressed on a subset of macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM, and their expression is associated with immunosuppressive functions.
- CADM1: This antigen is expressed on macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM, and its expression is associated with immunosuppressive functions.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting in GBM. For example, the article discusses the potential of targeting CD163+ macrophages with anti-CD163 antibodies as a therapeutic strategy. Additionally, the article mentions that CD163 and CX3CR1 are potential targets for immunotherapy in GBM, as they are associated with immunosuppressive functions.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- IDH1 wildtype
- pMGMT
- IDH2

These antigens are not mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text. However, the paper does discuss the potential significance of these molecular markers in determining the prognosis of glioblastoma patients.

The paper highlights that the presence of IDH1 wildtype and pMGMT methylation status did not show a significant difference between cystic and non-cystic glioblastomas. This suggests that the improved survival observed in cystic glioblastomas is not solely due to these molecular markers.

Additionally, the paper mentions that none of the studies included in the review compared the presence of 1p/19q co-deletion or IDH2 mutation status. Zhou et al. suggested that the association of cystic glioblastoma with telomere length and pMGMT methylation should be further analyzed.

It is important to note that the overall quality of the evidence in this study was low, and the authors recommend future prospective studies with better control for bias to investigate the survival outcomes of cystic versus non-cystic glioblastoma.

The paper also highlights the role of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment and their association with angiogenesis, immune response, and tumor progression.

Here is the relevant information extracted from the paper:

- S100A8 and S100A9: These proteins are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells and are associated with poor prognosis. They are involved in maintaining tumor angiogenesis and promoting malignant progression.

- MMP9: This protein is associated with the pathological grading of gliomas and predicts poor prognosis. Patients with lower MMP9 expression are more likely to benefit from TMZ treatment, regardless of MGMT-methylation status.

- CXCR1: This chemokine receptor is significantly overexpressed in patients with glioma compared to normal individuals. It is involved in promoting neutrophil maturation, survival, and recruitment, and is associated with tumor-promoting activity.

I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- PD1/PD-L1
- CTLA-4

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. The study suggests that high expression of REST may be associated with the expression of these immune checkpoints, which are known to play a role in tumor immune escape. The authors propose that targeting REST could potentially increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in glioma.

Additionally, the study mentions the following antigens in the context of immune cell infiltration in glioma:

- B cell biomarkers (CD19 and CD79A)
- CD4+ immune cell biomarker (CD4)
- M1 macrophage biomarkers (IRF5 and PTGS2)
- M2 macrophage biomarkers (CD163, VSIG4, and MS4A4A)
- Neutrophil biomarker (ITGAM)
- Dendritic cell biomarkers (HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DPA1, CD1C, NRP1, and ITGAX)

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but they are discussed in relation to immune cell infiltration and the tumor microenvironment in glioma.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and is involved in ECM remodeling and fibrogenesis. FAP is expressed at low to non-detectable levels in normal organs but is greatly upregulated at sites of tissue remodeling and tumor stroma.

- FAP is involved in various pathological processes and can be detected in more than 90% of malignant epithelial tumors. Targeting FAP is a promising approach for molecular imaging technologies, including positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), as FAP inhibitors exhibit rapid and almost complete internalization upon administration and rapid clearance from the circulation.

- FAP expression is associated with worse prognosis in colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and hepatocellular cancer. The first clinical application of FAP-based imaging involving the use of antibodies and boronic acid-based inhibitor molecules demonstrated limited clinical value due to the low blood clearance rate and limitations associated with gamma imaging.

- More recently, quinoline-based FAPIs have been developed as radiopharmaceuticals for PET/CT imaging. As a novel PET/CT tracer, FAPIs were compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in tumor detection rate and clinical efficiency, showing a higher sensitivity in identifying primary tumors and metastases involving lymph node, bone, and viscera.

- The novel imaging agent FAPI is currently applied during clinical practice to diagnose and manage several malignant tumors and their associated metastases. In this respect, Jiang et al. and Kuten et al. have observed a higher tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) in FAPI than in FDG, with little variations and fluctuations in the SUVmax in ovarian cancers and colorectal cancers.

- In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, FAP recognition and inhibition via 4-1 BB bispecific agonists have been proposed as a potential strategy for tumor-targeted therapy.

I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- **Neuroligin-3 (NLGN3)**: NLGN3 is a synaptic adhesion molecule that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. It is secreted by neurons and OPCs during neuronal activity and is essential for the formation of functional synapses between neurons and glioma cells. NLGN3 has been proposed as a potential target for immunotherapy, as it is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is required for glioma progression.

- **Thrombospondin-3 (TSP3)**: TSP3 is a matricellular protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. It is involved in synaptogenesis and has been associated with glioma progression. TSP3 has been identified as a potential biomarker for glioma, and its expression levels have been found to correlate with preoperative global oscillatory brain activity.

- **Oligodendrocyte lineage genes (OLIG)**: OLIG genes, such as OLIG2, are expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells and are involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and glioma development. OLIG2 is a well-known marker for oligodendrocyte lineage cells and has been used to identify glioma cells in human glioblastoma.

- **Neural stem cell (NSC) markers**: NSCs are a potential cell-of-origin for glioma, and NSC markers, such as SOX2, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. NSCs are a promising target for immunotherapy, as they are involved in glioma initiation and progression.

- **Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) markers**: OPCs are another potential cell-of-origin for glioma, and OPC markers, such as NG2, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. OPCs are synaptogenic, proliferative, and plastic, and they have been shown to drive glioma development.

- **Glioma stem cell (GSC) markers**: GSCs are a subpopulation of glioma cells that are highly proliferative and are thought to drive glioma progression. GSC markers, such as CD133, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. GSCs are a promising target for immunotherapy, as they are involved in glioma initiation and progression.

These antigens have been proposed as potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor targeting in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as they are highly expressed in these cancer cells and are involved in glioma development and progression. However, further research is needed to validate their clinical utility and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular diagnostics:

- IDH1 R132H
- ATRX
- p53

These antigens are used as markers for specific mutations or alterations in glioma cells. For instance, IDH1 R132H is a mutation-specific marker for IDH1-mutant gliomas, while ATRX and p53 are associated with ATRX deficiency and p53 mutation, respectively.

The paper does not provide information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
