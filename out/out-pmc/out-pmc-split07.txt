- **Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)**: EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently amplified and overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies. EGFR amplification is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in glioblastoma.

- **Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT)**: TERT is a catalytic subunit of telomerase, which is an enzyme that maintains telomere length and promotes cellular immortality. TERT promoter mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased telomerase activity and poor prognosis. TERT is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting approaches.

- **Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B)**: CDKN2A/B are tumor suppressor genes that encode the proteins p16INK4A and p14ARF, respectively. These proteins regulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B is associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT is a DNA repair enzyme that removes alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine, thereby reversing the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents like temozolomide. MGMT promoter methylation status is a critical factor in predicting response to temozolomide in glioblastoma. MGMT expression is associated with resistance to temozolomide and poor prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

- **Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH)**: IDH is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. IDH mutations are common in gliomas, and IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. IDH mutations are also associated with increased sensitivity to metformin, as mentioned in the paper.

- **p53**: p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair. p53 mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **ATRX**: ATRX is a chromatin remodeler that is involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. ATRX mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and poor prognosis.

- **PTEN**: PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. PTEN mutations or deletions are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **p16 and p14**: p16 and p14 are tumor suppressor proteins encoded by the CDKN2A/B gene. p16 (INK4A) inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, while p14 (ARF) stabilizes p53. Homozygous deletion of p16 and p14 is associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

These antigens are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and poor prognosis. They are potential targets for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies, as they can be used to develop specific antibodies or other targeted therapies to selectively kill cancer cells expressing these antigens.

The paper does not provide information about antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It also does not mention any antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein
- FGFR3
- TACC3
- OLIG2
- GFAP
- OLIG2
- GFAP
- CDK4
- MDM2

These antigens are specifically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are not mentioned in the context of other cancer types in this paper. The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is a recurrent oncogenic fusion protein found in about 3% of squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial carcinoma, 3.9% of cervical cancer patients, and 4% of glioblastoma patients. The FGFR3 gene and the TACC3 gene are located on chromosome 4p16.3, only 48kb apart from each other within a region that is associated with translocation-causing breakpoints in multiple myeloma. This spatial proximity and the localization at a double-strand hotspot is one theory explaining why this fusion protein is found so frequently. An alternative explanation of the frequent recurrence of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion is that the fusion protein leads to specific survival benefits, such as proliferation gain and increased cell survival. Cells that express the fusion protein might thereby prevail in a setting of selection pressure.

The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is involved in several cellular processes and signaling cascades, leading to FGFR3-TACC3 overexpression, increased kinase activity, and corresponding downstream signaling, morphological changes, increased cell growth, altered cellular metabolism, stress response, and even dysregulated mitotic progression, resulting in aneuploidy. The kinase activity of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein plays a crucial role in the proliferation and survival of glioblastoma cells. The ability to dimerize TACC3 leads to the presence of a constitutively dimerized, and thereby activated, FGFR3 tyrosine kinase domain in fusion-positive tumor cells and hyperactivated downstream signaling, resulting in an overexpression of phosphorylated FRS2, the initial intracellular binding partner of FGFR3, to activate ERK1/2 and AKT signaling. Parker et al. detected an increased activation of pERK, but not of STAT3 and pAKT, in fusion-positive cells while other authors saw enhanced STAT3 and STAT1 activation. Nelson et al. showed that only plasma membrane localized FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein leads to formation of oncogenic foci in fusion transfected NIH3T3 cells. This goes along with increased MAPK signaling activation, while cytoplasmatic localized FGFR3-TACC3 does not induce oncogenic transformation, supporting the hypothesis that the oncogenic force of the fusion protein is dependent on its kinase activity. The phosphorylation site Y746 is of major importance for activation of ERK, STAT and PI3K signaling. Y746 is hyperphosphorylated in FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive cells and MAPK activation is increased in fusion-positive cells. Treatment with the kinase inhibitors BGJ398 and trametinib resulted in reduction in MAPK signaling and had an antitumor effect in FGFR3-TACCex11 and FGFR3-TACC3ex8 transfected cells, but the signaling and treatment response differed between the two isoforms.

TACC3 in its wildtype form is phosphorylated by Aurora-A and forms a complex with clathrin and ch-TOG, which is localized to the mitotic spindle apparatus and provides its stability. When fused to the FGFR3-protein, TACC3 lacks a phosphorylation site for Aurora-A. Confocal imaging of FGFR3-TACC3 showed an arc-shaped structure of the protein, bending over and enchasing the metaphase spindle poles, but not relocating to the mid body, leading to erratic mitotic segregation. FGFR3-TACC3-positive cells exhibit a 3 to 5-fold higher number of errors in chromosomal segregation and resulting aneuploidy, an effect, that could be reduced to 80% by treatment with the kinase inhibitor PD173074. This, however, implies that the activity of FGFR3-TACC3 in aneuploidy induction is dependent on its kinase activity.

Gene ontology mapping of the dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed enriched expression of genes that are related to oxidative phosphorylation, high mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Additionally, increased mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial mass, and higher levels of ATP were detected in FGFR3-TACC3 transfected astrocytes compared to control cells, and the fusion-positive cells showed an elevated basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate, as well as a mild increase in the extracellular acidification rate. Gene expression levels of the respiratory complex proteins SDHB, UQCRC1, ATP5A1, and the mitochondrial membrane transporter VDAC1 were elevated in fusion-positive cells. Anti-pY immunoprecipitation showed that only FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive cells contained phosphorylated PIN4, an activator of mitochondrial metabolism and anabolic response, leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species and thereby, elevated expression of the transcription regulators PGC1α and ERRγ, which increase mitochondrial metabolism. Accordingly, the FGFR3-TACC3-positive cells were sensitive towards treatment with mitochondrial inhibitors such as menadione, metformin, and tigecycline in vitro.

Besides this, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion leads to morphological changes characterized by the rounding up of the cells in HEK293T cells, the activation of cell signaling pathways related to chaperone activation, the stress response and regulation of tp53 expression, and the degradation and resistance to EGFR inhibitors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma cells.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies regarding treatment with FGFR-inhibitors for FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive gliomas have led to promising results. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZD4547, PD173074, BGJ398, and JNJ-42756493 inhibited the proliferation of FGFR3-TACC3 transfected astrocytes in vitro and led to reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in glioma-bearing mice. PD173074 was even more able to suppress the kinase phosphorylation of FGFR3 and reduced aneuploidy by about 80%. In FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioma cell lines, the FGFR-inhibitors PD173074 and AZD4547 had an antiproliferative effect, and the kinase inhibitor pazopanib caused cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, a higher sensitivity of fusion-positive glioma cells towards the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 was observed.

In other cancer cell lines, such as cholangiocarcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma, a higher potency of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has also been described. Parker-Kerrigan et al. transfected 10 unique siRNAs into glioblastoma and bladder cancer cell lines, which led to the depletion of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein, while wildtype FGFR3 was not affected. The siRNA knockdown of FGFR3-TACC3 in glioblastoma cells leads to reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

A small number of case reports regarding the use of kinase inhibitors in patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioblastomas exists: Wang et al. treated two patients with the kinase inhibitor anlotinib. A 65-year-old woman with a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioblastoma, diagnosed in 01/2020, received anlotinib after she had tumor progress following gross total resection and treatment with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide and five adjuvant cycles of temozolomide. She had partial response after three months of treatment with anlotinib and was still alive at the time of publication. The second patient, a 44-year-old woman, was diagnosed with FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma in 12/2017. She was treated with radiochemotherapy, according to the STUPP-regimen, and afterwards received treatment with nedaplatin and bevacizumab. In 06/2018, she had tumor progress and started treatment with a temozolomide rescue scheme and anlotinib. After two months, she had partial response and was also still alive when the authors published the article.

The kinase inhibitor JNJ-42756493 was also administered to two glioblastoma patients, a 52-year-old man and a 64-year-old woman, who were both diagnosed with FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma. Both patients underwent gross total resection of the tumor, followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. After they experienced tumor progress, both received JNJ-42756493. The first patient reached stable disease for 115 days before he exhibited new tumor progression, while the second patient had partial response after 4 weeks and was on treatment for 134 days before she exhibited progressive disease. The pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib (JNJ-42756493) was administered to 65 patients with solid tumors in a phase 1 trial. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were detected in one glioblastoma patient, two urothelial carcinoma patients, and one patient with adrenal carcinoma who showed partial response under treatment with erdafitinib.

Currently, there are diverse ongoing trials regarding the use of tyrosine kinase receptors in FGFR3-TACC3 positive glioblastomas. The FGFR1-3 receptor inhibitors AZ4547 and BGJ398 were both evaluated for patients with FGFR1-TACC1 and FGFR3-TACC3 fused glioblastomas; however, the results have not yet been published. A study considering infigratinib (BGJ398) for patients with unselected FGFR-altered glioblastoma proved the safety of the drug, despite only limited effects. Nevertheless, response with a stable disease for over one year was observed in a patient with a FGFR3-TACC3-fused glioblastoma.

The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is a promising target for personalized diagnostics and specific therapy in glioblastoma. Its specific functional and clinical relevance should justify further effort to answer open questions and establish the markers in daily clinical practice.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- IDH1 R132H
- Ki-67
- Nestin

These antigens were used as immunohistochemical markers in the study, and their expression was evaluated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and IDH-mutant astrocytoma samples. The study did not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.

The study did not mention these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, it is worth noting that the authors discussed the potential role of IDH1 mutations in therapeutic management, highlighting ongoing clinical trials with chemotherapeutics and targeted vaccines targeting the IDH1 mutation.
- **Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX)**: ATRX is a protein that plays a role in genomic stability and cell division. ATRX mutations cause genomic instability, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT), as well as increasing susceptibility to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Loss of nuclear ATRX expression due to ATRX gene mutation has been correlated with a survival benefit and is mainly seen in secondary GBM, IDH mutant. ATRX expression was found in 91.2% of patients in this study, with 8.8% showing loss of nuclear ATRX expression.

- **Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)**: EGFR plays a central role in cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, and angiogenesis, as well as influencing DNA repair and contributing to radio- and chemotherapy resistance. Amplification of the EGFR gene occurs in 30-50% of IDH-wildtype GBMs and is correlated with overexpression of EGFR protein. The most common mutated variant in GBM is tumor-specific EGFR splice variant III (EGFRvIII) which results from gene truncation and has been associated with worse survival prognosis and increased carcinogenicity. Current data concerning the survival correlation of EGFR are inconclusive, with some studies showing shorter survival and some studies showing no correlation with survival. A large meta-analysis concluded that most studies did not regard confounders and/or did not differentiate EGFR wildtype from EGFR mutations, so no clear statement could be made regarding EGFR status and survival prognosis. EGFRvIII expression was found in 40.9% of patients in this study, with a borderline significant correlation in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, which did not hold up in univariate and multivariate analysis.

- **Ki-67**: Ki-67 is a protein expressed exclusively in proliferating cells, with the Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) correlating closely with histological tumor grade in gliomas. A Ki-67 LI of 10% is regarded as a reliable criterion for malignancy. Although some studies see Ki-67 LI as a reliable predictor of survival with higher Ki-67 LI indicating worse prognosis, more reliable even than histologic grade or age, other studies could not find this association, possibly due to low reproducibility of Ki-67 LI detection between laboratories and examiners. Therefore, the role of Ki-67 LI as a prognostic factor is still disputed. A median Ki-67 LI of 20% is in line with the malignant nature and high proliferation of GBMs and averages approximately in between previously published data. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with lower Ki-67 LI < 20%, matching previous studies. The present study was able to show a tendency toward better overall survival in patients with a reduction of Ki-67 LI upon progression or recurrence, with statistical significance being reached for a median Ki-67 LI quotient of 2, but with significance being missed for both an absolute median reduction of 6% as well as for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Ki-67 LI quotient ≤ 1 vs. > 1, which could be due to the small sample size. As mentioned above, the role of Ki-67 LI as a prognostic factor is still disputed due to differing results concerning its impact on survival. A previous study has discussed suboptimal methodological approaches as a possible factor in this variance. In the present study, the strength of the study lies firstly in the monocentric approach, seeing as Ki-67 LI detection took place at a single laboratory and with minimal examiner variance, and secondly in the inclusion of treatment criteria via analysis of the partial collective "favorable subgroup," making the significant results regarding Ki-67 LI and progression-free survival more reliable. Furthermore, the approach of integrating Ki-67 LI into the existing RPA score allows for the inclusion of further prognostic factors and could, in the authors' eyes, show that inclusion of Ki-67 LI can contribute to an improved assessment of survival. Concerning a possible impact of Ki-67 LI on treatment stratification, to the authors' knowledge, no data exist regarding glioblastoma, and this was also not the focus of the study. However, Ki-67 has been shown to impact treatment response in neuroendocrine neoplasms, prostate cancer, and metastatic lung carcinoids, as well as impacting treatment options for breast cancer. Such promising results in other malign entities combined with the prognostic value of Ki-67 LI as seen and discussed in the study emphasize the need for prospective trials to investigate a possible role of Ki-67 LI in stratification for treatment of glioblastoma.

- **O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT is involved in the repair of DNA strands by removing genotoxic alkyl groups from guanine. Methylation of the MGMT promoter reduces MGMT expression and thereby increases sensitivity to alkylating chemotherapy. Therefore, MGMT promoter methylation is consistently correlated with better survival when alkylating treatment has been performed. MGMT promoter methylation was more common in the study collective than expected, with 60% of patients having a methylated MGMT promoter compared to 40% in previously published data. A significantly better progression-free and overall survival in all collectives is in line with known data, with overall survival of 13 months for non-methylated and 18 months for methylated MGMT promoter coinciding with previous studies.

The paper does not provide information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, their expression levels across different cancer types, or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
- CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4)
- PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha)
- DDIT3 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3)
- KIT (KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase)

These antigens are mentioned in the context of their expression levels across different cancer types, with the article noting that they are found at varying frequencies in glioblastoma cases. For example, EGFR is amplified in 47.9% of cases, CDK4 in 18.2%, PDGFRA in 14.2%, DDIT3 in 10.8%, and KIT in 10.8%.

The article also discusses the potential implications of these antigens for immunotherapy and tumor targeting. It highlights that the knockout of some of these genes, such as EGFR and CDK4, can significantly impact the proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines. This suggests that targeting these antigens with immunotherapeutic approaches could be a promising strategy for treating IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

However, the article does not provide specific details about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their potential as immunotherapy targets. Further research and validation would be required to fully explore these aspects.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
- Angiogenesis genes
- 2-HG

**VEGF:**
VEGF is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype gliomas, which are described as having higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. This is contrary to previous reports, suggesting that the relationship between VEGF expression and IDH status is complex and may vary depending on other factors.

**Angiogenesis genes:**
Angiogenesis genes are upregulated in contrast enhancement regions of IDH-wildtype gliomas, leading to increased contrast. This finding highlights the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of these tumors and their potential as therapeutic targets.

**2-HG:**
2-HG is a signature metabolite produced by IDH mutations, and its increase is associated with tumor cell proliferation. The article discusses the potential of using 2-HG as a prognostic marker and a target for noninvasive detection of IDH mutation status through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

While these antigens are not explicitly mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, their strong expression in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells suggests that they could be potential targets for immunotherapeutic approaches or tumor-targeting strategies. However, further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of these antigens in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- IDH1: IDH1 is a prognostic marker for glioma, with IDH1 mutations associated with a favourable prognosis and IDH1 wildtype associated with lower overall survival. IDH1 is also used in the diagnosis of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, with IDH1 wildtype characterising glioblastomas.
- IDH2: IDH2 mutations are also favourable prognostic factors and can facilitate the diagnosis of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, while IDH2 wildtype is associated with lower overall survival and characterises glioblastomas.
- MGMT: MGMT promoter methylation is a favourable prognostic factor associated with enhanced sensitivity to alkylating agents in chemotherapy.
- ATRX: ATRX mutations are associated with wildtype 1p/19q and with mutations in IDH1/2 and TP53, and may be involved in alternative lengthening of telomeres, contributing to genomic instability.
- TP53: TP53 is a prognostic factor for glioma, with gain of function mutations in the TP53 gene causing overexpression of p53 protein, which is associated with shorter overall survival.
- P53: P53 expression is significantly positively correlated with age at diagnosis and is a prognostic marker for glioma.
- Palladin: Palladin is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for glioma, with overexpression of wild-type palladin's isoform 4 originating mostly from the malignant cell population and being involved in the progression of aggressive adult glioma tumours. Palladin expression is correlated with decreased survival and is a stronger predictor of overall survival than currently used prognostic markers.

- SRPX2: SRPX2 is a secreted protein that plays a role in the extracellular matrix and has been associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma. It promotes tumour progression and metastasis in primary GICs. SRPX2 expression is highest in regions of microvascular proliferation and hyperplastic blood vessels, while it is lowest in the leading edge and infiltrating tumour. SRPX2 knockdown leads to impaired invasion in two BE-GIC lines in in vitro assays.
- RARRES2: RARRES2 is a chemoattractant that binds to Chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1). It is significantly up-regulated in BE-GICs compared to nBE-GICs, in both the authors' cohort and the HGCC cohort, and in non-G-CIMP tumour tissue relative to non-tumour brain tissue. High expression of RARRES2 is correlated with a worse prognosis. RARRES2 is well known to play a role in inflammation and promoting the migration of plasmacytoid DC, macrophages, and NK-cells. In scRNAseq data from Pombo Antunes et al., 2021, and Neftel et al., 2019, the receptor CMKLR1 is expressed in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) from newly diagnosed GBMs, particularly in non-hypoxic TAMs as compared to hypoxic TAMs in recurrent glioblastomas.
