I'm sorry, I could not find any information in the provided text about antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The text does not mention any specific antigens or their expression levels in different cancer types. It also does not discuss immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of these antigens.
- GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)
- S-100 (S100 calcium-binding protein B)
- Olig-2 (Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2)
- ATRX (Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)

However, they are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as indicated by the immunohistochemical data presented in the paper. The text does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
- Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT)

EGFR is mentioned in the context of immunotherapy, as it is a target for monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. TERT is not mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
- **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**: EGFR is overexpressed in most primary glioblastomas and some secondary glioblastomas, particularly in more aggressive glioblastoma phenotypes. Mutations in EGFR occur in roughly one-third of all classical tumors and often in mesenchymal, proneural, and neural glioblastomas. The article mentions that EGFR activation can be increased in various ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ways, and that EGFR is overexpressed in glioblastoma, promoting tumor growth and invasion.

- **GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)**: GFAP is an intermediate filament protein found in gliomas that astrocytes and neural progenitor cells generate. Changes in GFAP alternative splicing are linked to glioma malignancy. The canonical isoform GFAP is downregulated in higher-grade cancers, resulting in greater GFAP isoform dominance in the network. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of GFAP across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **TP53**: TP53 is one of the most commonly deregulated genes in cancer. The p53-ARF-MDM2 pathway is deregulated in 84% of glioblastoma patients and 94% of glioblastoma cell lines. Deregulated p53 pathway components have been implicated in glioblastoma cell invasion, migration, proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, and cancer cell stemness. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of TP53 across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **ATRX (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked)**: ATRX is a chromatin remodeler protein, recurrently mutated in WHO grade II/III astrocytic glioma and secondary glioblastoma. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of ATRX across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Ki-67**: Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that reflects the physiological proliferative state of the cells in which this marker is expressed. The Ki-67 labeling index (LI) increases with increasing WHO grade, and high Ki-67 expression is related to lesion volume, an increased risk of recurrence, and a poor prognosis. The article mentions that Ki-67 is evaluated using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, which stains nuclei reacting with nuclear proteins expressed in the cell cycle's GI, S, G2, and M phases. The nuclear positivity found for Ki-67 is expressed in percentage, KI-67 labeling index (LI). The article also discusses the correlation between the percentage staining of Ki-67 and overall survival in patients with IDH-WT glioblastoma, specifically that the percentage of Ki-67 staining >20% predicts poorer progression-free survival. However, there is still a debate on this in the literature, and existing papers report different results.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- MDM2
- p53

MDM2 is a protein that is upregulated in a multitude of cancers, including glioblastoma, and is associated with a poor prognosis. Gene amplification, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region, increased transcription, and enhanced translation of MDM2 may cause an enhanced degradation and decreased activity of p53. MDM2 amplification is the most frequent cause of MDM2 overexpression and occurs in approximately 3.5% of all malignancies. Up to 65% of well-differentiated and de-differentiated liposarcomas have a high rate of MDM2 amplification, while several other solid malignancies, including GBM, soft-tissue and bone sarcomas, gallbladder and duodenal adenocarcinoma, lung adenosquamous carcinoma, and ovarian carcinosarcoma, have a frequency of approximately 15%. In most tumors, MDM2 amplification is mutually exclusive to TP53 mutation.

p53 is the most frequently mutated gene across all types of cancer, with mutations occurring in about 50% of malignancies. The mutation prevalence of TP53 among different cancer types varies, ranging from less than 5% in cervical cancer to up to 90% in ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer. In lower grade (CNS WHO grade 2 and 3) gliomas, TP53 is deregulated in approximately 50% of cases, most commonly in co-occurrence with IDH1 mutations. The majority (>70%) of CNS WHO grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas harbor TP53 mutations. According to The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), TP53 is mutated in up to 30% of GBMs. While missense substitutions account for the most common TP53 mutations (~70%), other alterations, such as frameshift insertions/deletions, nonsense mutations, and silent mutations, are less common. Human cancers frequently have segmental deletions on chromosome 17p, which involves the TP53 locus. Although most TP53 mutations are detrimental (i.e., they cause a loss of function), some mutations in TP53 are innocuous, allowing p53 to continue acting as a transcription factor. There have also been reports of tumorigenic gain-of-function mutations in TP53.

The article mentions that the interaction between MDM2 and p53 has emerged as a promising strategy for combating cancer, including the treatment of glioblastoma. Numerous MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and are currently undergoing rigorous testing for their potential in GBM therapy. Encouraging results from studies conducted in cell culture and animal models suggest that MDM2 inhibitors could effectively treat a specific subset of GBM patients with wild-type TP53 or functional p53. Combination therapy with clinically established treatment modalities such as radiation and chemotherapy offers the potential to achieve a more profound therapeutic response. Furthermore, an increasing array of other molecularly targeted therapies are being explored in combination with MDM2 inhibitors to increase the effects of individual treatments. While some MDM2 inhibitors have progressed to early phase clinical trials in GBM, their efficacy, alone and in combination, is yet to be confirmed.

The article also discusses the potential of MDM2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma, highlighting the importance of the MDM2-p53 interaction in cancer development and the potential of targeting this interaction for cancer treatment. The article mentions that MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and are currently being explored for their possible use in cancer treatment, with some of these inhibitors having progressed to clinical testing. However, the article does not provide specific information on the expression levels of MDM2 and p53 across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

The paper does not provide specific information about antigens highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it mentions the use of anti-EpCAM antibodies for detecting or enriching circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream. EpCAM (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule) is a cell surface protein that is often overexpressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma. The paper also discusses the challenges in detecting CTCs in malignant astrocytoma due to the absence of EpCAM expression in glioma cells, which is a crucial consideration for immunotherapy and tumor targeting strategies.
The paper does not provide specific information on antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it mentions the following antigens in the context of immunohistochemical staining and molecular profiling:

- Although PRAME has its primary application in the diagnosis of melanoma, PRAME was also found to be expressed by various epithelial and non-epithelial cancers, including uterine carcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, ovarian carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, seminoma, thymic carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, synovial sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and neuroblastoma.
- The biological and clinicopathological implications of PRAME expression have been unknown in adult gliomas.
- PRAME has been recently introduced as a prognostic and/or oncogenic biomarker of various cancer types, including melanocytic neoplasms, invasive breast carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and hematological malignancies.
- PRAME has also been found to be expressed by various types of neoplasms as mentioned earlier.
- Regarding CNS tumors, the significance of PRAME expression has been investigated in medulloblastoma as a biomarker for immunotherapy.
- Little is known about the biological and clinical significance of the PRAME protein and its corresponding gene in glioma.
- The intensity and pattern of PRAME and its gene expression in glioma are still under investigation.
- In the present study, the authors found that most of these tumors still expressed PRAME at a low level and a minority of them, however, showed gene overexpression.
- Even with low expression, the PRAME-expressing glioma still had distinct biological characteristics, which was shown in subsequent analyses.
- Further studies to validate PRAME protein expression in glioma, using western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, or other techniques, are needed because it is not clear whether PRAME gene expression can be an indicator of its protein status.
- The nCounter Nanostring PanCancer Pathways panel was used to evaluate the biological profiles of human cancers in previous studies.
- Using this panel, the authors' PCA analysis illustrated that PRAME expression status can be a biomarker of glioma biology although further interpretations are not available in such general results.
- Pathway analysis showed more details in the biological difference among PRAME expression statuses.
- In glioma, the Wnt/β-catenin signal promotes neurogenesis and cell proliferation while the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is associated with growth, metabolism, autophagy, survival, and chemotherapy resistance of glioblastoma.
- The hedgehog signaling pathway is also required for glioma-initiating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
- These pathways were increased in PRAME-positive gliomas.
- However, various oncogenic processes or signals in PRAME-positive gliomas such as E2F targets, G2M mitotic checkpoint, reactive oxidative oxygen species, IL6-JAK-STAT6, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and mTORC1 were activated at the lower levels compared to PRAME-negative tumors.
- These results were controversial, suggesting biological heterogeneity in PRAME-positive tumors.
- Recent studies showed dozens of clinicopathological risk factors with prognostic significance in adult gliomas.
- Clinically, age, tumor size, and tumor location within CNS are predictive factors of glioma patient outcomes.
- Pathologically, histological glioma subtypes and WHO grade are also related to glioma prognosis.
- Regarding genetic abnormalities, CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, EGFR amplification, TP53 mutations, ATRX mutations, TERT promoter mutations, and 7 gain 10 loss chromosomal abnormalities are associated with poor prognosis while IDH1/2 mutations are closely related to superior outcomes.
- Regarding gene expression, a previous study developed a stemness index from the regularized cox model to predict the prognosis of glioma patients.
- Therefore, it is important to show the prognostic significance of a biomarker by adjusting such confounders in a multivariate analysis.
- In the present study, the authors found that PRAME positivity was an independent prognostic factor to other clinicopathological factors.
- Interestingly, the authors found that PRAME gene overexpression, which is more likely visualized by the protein expression detection methods, was related to a subgroup with a significantly worse prognosis than PRAME-low gliomas despite its small sample size.
- DNA methylation profile was proven to be pathologically associated with CNS tumors.
- A methylation-based random forest classifier was developed to provide a novel biological fingerprint of CNS tumors in addition to other identifiers such as histopathology and genetic abnormalities.
- Another study also argued that methylation profiling can be a reliable biomarker for further low-grade glioma subtyping.
- Therefore, examining whether there is a relationship between PRAME expression status and DNA methylation characteristics can further consolidate PRAME value in glioma biology.
- The authors' study showed that PRAME-positive gliomas were distributed more densely in the IDH-wildtype-related methylation cluster compared to the other cluster.
- Although this specific distribution of PRAME-positive tumors can be attributed to the dense clustering of grade 4 tumors, the authors believe that PRAME positivity and negativity can still be an indicator of DNA methylation profile, regardless of the causal relationships.
- PRAME can also be associated with glioma TME.
- A previous study showed that Decitabine can increase PRAME expression and, thus, enhance the T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which makes PRAME an interesting target for immunotherapy.
- However, TME of cell line can be difficult to interpret because the stromal or microenvironment context of cancer in vivo is different from that of cell line condition.
- The authors' study showed that PRAME higher expression was related to increased cytotoxic cell, macrophage, and neutrophil activity but it was also associated with many immune modulating cells such as Th2, Th17, and TFH.
- Therefore, PRAME expression is in a complicated relationship with many immunologic cell populations, not only cytotoxic T cells.
- However, there were limitations in the present study.
- First, selection bias was a potential problem because this study used a public database.
- Second, the authors' findings of PRAME positivity in IDH-mutant glioma were not significant potentially due to small samples, and, thus, sampling error.
- Therefore, a larger study of PRAME expression on IDH-mutant glioma can be helpful to examine the biological and clinicopathological relevance of PRAME positivity in these brain tumors.
- Third, protein expression data was not fully available and, therefore, cannot be analyzed.
- PRAME gene expression may be different from PRAME protein expression, which can be practically evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
- Hence, immunohistochemical studies are required to validate PRAME prognostic significance at the protein level.
- Additionally, data about histone modification is not available in TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM projects.
- Therefore, the authors were not able to analyze the relationship between PRAME expression and this epigenetic regulation.
- Finally, to the authors' knowledge, there was no available information of chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance in TCGA datasets.
- Hence, the authors were not able to investigate the relationship between PRAME expression and treatment response.
- The authors' study illustrated that a proportion of glioma did not express PRAME while the majority of glioma expressed PRAME, among which a few tumors possessed high PRAME expression.
- PRAME-positive tumors had different biological (gene expression, DNA methylation, and pathway) and clinicopathological characteristics, which were related to IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- In survival analysis, PRAME positivity, especially PRAME overexpression, was related to poor prognosis.

The paper does not provide specific information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of glioblastoma and other cancer types:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): FAP is a membrane protease that is highly expressed in many tumors, including glioblastoma, but is absent or insignificant in most normal tissues. The paper discusses the potential of FAP as a biomarker for glioma detection and monitoring, as well as its role in tumor progression.

- Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2): These molecular biomarkers play a role in patient stratification, delineation of risk groups, and prognostication of treatment response in glioma. The paper mentions that IDH-wildtype gliomas have a worse prognosis compared to IDH-mutant gliomas.

- O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT): MGMT is another molecular biomarker that influences the prognosis and treatment response in glioma. The paper discusses the methylation status of the MGMT promoter and its association with FAP levels.

While the paper does not explicitly mention these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, it highlights their potential as biomarkers for glioma diagnosis and monitoring. Further research and clinical studies would be needed to explore their role in immunotherapeutic approaches or targeted therapies for glioblastoma.

The paper does not provide specific information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens and their expression in various cancer types:

- **Lomustine**: A non-selective alkylating agent that induces the crosslinking of DNA/RNA in dividing cells, leading to cell apoptosis. It is used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.
- **Carmustine**: Binds to and alters the activity of glutathione reductase, and is used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.
- **Carmustine wafer implants**: Similar to carmustine, these implants bind to and alter the activity of glutathione reductase. They are used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.
- **Temozolomide (TMZ)**: A non-specific alkylating agent that activates mismatch repair in DNA through methylation at the O6 position of guanine. It is used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.
- **Bevacizumab (BVZ)**: A targeted healing antibody that attaches to and hinders the activity of the VEGF protein within tumor cells. It is used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.

I have found the following information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed by stromal fibroblasts in more than 90% of epithelial cancers, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.
- FAP-specific PET/CT imaging has shown elevated tracer uptake in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas.
- The study by Röhrich et al. (2021) found that IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas showed elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.

The expression levels of FAP across different cancer types are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but the study by Röhrich et al. (2021) suggests that FAP is expressed in a variety of cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas, and other solid tumors.

There is no mention of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text.

I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on the role of PROX1 as a prognostic factor for patients with high-grade astrocytomas, but it does not provide details about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells.
- PD-L1: This antigen is highly expressed in human malignant gliomas, and its levels significantly correlate with the glioma grade. It is also highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with intense positive staining for PD-L1 observed in Grade IV gliomas, anaplastic astrocytoma, and GBM. The reported positivity of PD-L1 expression in GBM ranges from 61% to 88%. PD-L1 expression is controlled through the innate immune resistance mechanism by the constitutive oncogenic signaling, PI3K-AKT pathway in tumor cells.
- PD-L2: This antigen is exclusively expressed on APCs, including DCs and macrophages under homeostasis, and can be induced in a variety of other immune cells or non-immune cells in response to microenvironmental stimuli. In certain subsets of B cell lymphomas, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, follicular cell B cell lymphoma, and mediastinal B cell lymphoma, PD-L2 is highly up-regulated. The up-regulation of PD-L2 in lymphomas may result from the gene fusions between the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) transactivator (CIITA) and PD-L2.
- PD-1: This antigen is an inhibitory receptor mainly expressed on activated T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is also detectable on other lymphocyte subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells and B cells. The elevated expression of PD-1 has been detected in diverse advanced human cancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. The immunosuppressive activities of receptor PD-1 are initiated upon binding to one of its two ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, and mediated through multiple mechanisms.
- CTLA-4: This antigen is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and the first co-inhibitory molecule identified. It is not expressed by naive T cells but is rapidly induced in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon T-cell activation. The predominant functions of CTLA-4 are attributed to the effects on the two major subsets of CD4+ T cells: suppression of helper T cell activity and enhancement of Treg immunosuppression. The ligands of CTLA-4 are CD80 and CD86, both of which also signal through the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 and induce T-cell activation. Since CTLA-4 has a much higher affinity for both ligands than CD28, it effectively inhibits the ligand engagement to CD28, transduces inhibitory signals, and suppresses T-cell activation. Forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), a forkhead transcription factor, controls CTLA-4 expression. In return, when CTLA-4 is induced in Tregs, CTLA-4 mediates the down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86 on DCs, and thus reduces the potency of APCs to activate other T cells, critically controlling the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. In addition, CTLA-4 expressed by Tregs could bind to CD80/86 on DCs with high affinity, and then deliver a signal that induces IDO expression and triggers the IDO activity in DCs.
- IDO: This antigen is expressed by various tumor cells and DCs. Although not an immune checkpoint in the classical sense, IDO mediates several inhibitory pathways in various tumor types and suppresses anti-tumor immunity as a mammalian cytosolic enzyme. IDO is a tryptophan (Trp) catabolic enzyme responsible for Trp degradation through the kynurenine (Kyn) degradation pathway. IDO from tumor cells catabolizes Trp to numerous metabolites, including Kyn, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA). The maintenance and function of T cells require Trp. Therefore, the Trp degradation mediated by IDO suppresses T cell activation. Meanwhile, the metabolites, such as Kyn, 3-HK, and 3-HAA induce T cell apoptosis. In addition, when combined with TGF-β, Kyn could induce FoxP3 expression and stimulate Treg formation. And IDO expressed by tumor cells also induces Treg infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Together, these mechanisms exacerbate immune suppression associated with cancer development. In glioma, IDO expressed in glioma cells plays an important role in inhibiting T cell functions and contributes to Treg accumulation. Under normal physiology, the CNS parenchyma does not express IDO. However, 90% of GBM shows positive expression of IDO, which is further boosted in low-grade glioma, suggesting that IDO expression level correlates with the severity of glioma. Moreover, GBM patients with higher expression of IDO have a worse prognosis. However, a recent study showed that only 8% of GBM expressed IDO. Considering that the antibodies used in these studies, although different from one another, were all well-controlled for the detection specificity, these studies suggest that alternative splice variants and/or posttranslational modifications of IDO protein in GBM samples may result in antigenic variations, and thus the dichotomous findings of IDO in GBM.
- TIM-3: This antigen is mainly expressed on activated T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. It binds to galectin-9, through which it induces Th1 cell death and suppresses the anti-tumor immune response. The significance of TIM-3 has been demonstrated in different cancer models, including colon cancer, mammary carcinoma, and melanoma. In glioma patients, the expression of TIM-3 on CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells is significantly elevated compared to healthy controls, and the higher expression level of TIM-3 on T cells is associated with tumors of higher grades.
- KIRs (Killer inhibitory receptors): These are a collection of inhibitory receptors that can down-regulate NK cells' cytotoxic activity and inhibit cytokine secretion of NK cells. Many KIRs are also expressed on T cells and APCs. Activation of KIRs in T cells suppresses the cytolytic activities of these cells. Consistently, expressions of KIRs are detected in multiple cancer types and correlate with poor prognosis. Among KIRs, CD94/NKG2A is an NK inhibitory receptor expressed by most astrocytoma-infiltrating T cells. An anti-NKG2A antibody (IPH2201) is undergoing phase I/II trial testing in HNSCC patients (NCT02331875). This antibody could be applied to glioma clinical trials. Many other anti-KIR mAbs are also being tested in anti-tumor clinical trials. A phase I trial of anti-KIR (IPH2101) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia has been completed. Several studies involving anti-KIR (lirilumab) combined with anti-PD-1 (clinical trial NCT01714739) or with anti-CTLA4 (clinical trial NCT01750580) are undergoing on patients with hematologic and solid cancers. These trials will investigate the anti-cancer effect by simultaneously boosting both the innate immune activity, via anti-KIR, and the adaptive immune activity via anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4.
