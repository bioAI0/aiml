EGFR is a well-known antigen that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The paper mentions that EGFR amplification is a genomic alteration found in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, which is associated with a worse prognosis.

The paper does not provide specific information about the expression levels of EGFR across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, EGFR is a widely studied target for cancer immunotherapy, and its expression levels can vary across different cancer types.

I did not find any other antigens that met your criteria in the provided text.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGR4
- PAPPA
- LRRC3
- ANXA3

These antigens were found to be significantly up-regulated in the TMZ-resistant group of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The expression level of these genes was also observed to be higher in recurrent GBMs and the TMZ-resistant sectors of the TMZ-ITH patients, suggesting their role in contributing to TMZ resistance.

The paper also mentions that the expression level of the four TMZ-resistant markers predicted poor survival not only in the study cohort but also in an independent IDH-wt GBM cohort extracted from the TCGA dataset. This indicates that these antigens could be potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

However, the paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
- Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression is downregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, which restricts antigen presentation and contributes to immune escape.
- Fas-ligand expression is increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, facilitating cell death in leukocytes.
- Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are immunosuppressive cytokines secreted by IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, suppressing immune response.
- The signaling pathway of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) tends to have mutations that occur more often in the IDH-wildtype glioblastoma of biological female patients.
- The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has genetic changes that occur more frequently in the helical domain for females and the kinase domain for males in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, demonstrating a sex preference for mutation location.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- TERT promoter mutations: Detectable in 56.3% of IDH wild-type patients, these mutations are associated with glioblastoma driver mutations.
- Nestin: A protein expressed in neural stem cells and glioblastoma stem cells, nestin is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation.
- CD133: A cell surface marker associated with cancer stem cells, CD133 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been linked to tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy.
- CD44: A cell adhesion molecule, CD44 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis.
- SOX2: A transcription factor involved in maintaining stem cell properties, SOX2 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been associated with tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and their potential role in tumor development and progression. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the molecular characteristics of glioblastoma, particularly in relation to the subventricular zone, for the development of targeted therapies.

Regarding their expression levels across different cancer types, the paper does not provide specific information. However, it is worth noting that these antigens are not exclusive to glioblastoma and may be expressed in other cancer types as well. For example, CD133 is a well-known marker for cancer stem cells in various solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer. Similarly, CD44 is widely expressed in many cancer types and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper does not provide direct information. However, the identification of these antigens and their association with glioblastoma stem cells could have implications for the development of targeted therapies. For instance, targeting these antigens with specific antibodies or small molecules could potentially inhibit the growth and spread of glioblastoma stem cells, leading to improved treatment outcomes. Additionally, the study's findings suggest that the subventricular zone, a region rich in neural stem cells, may play a crucial role in glioblastoma pathogenesis and resistance to therapy. This knowledge could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target the subventricular zone and its associated stem cell populations.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- HLA-G: Expressed on the surface of glioma cells, HLA-G can bind to CD8A on T cells, inducing a Fas-FasL mediated apoptosis of CD8+ T cells.
- CD70: Expressed on the surface of glioma cells, CD70 interacts with its corresponding receptor to cause T cell dysfunction and enable immune evasion.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR
- MGMT
- ATRX
- p53
- Ki67

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as predictive markers for glioblastoma patient survival. The study also highlights the importance of considering the use of steroids for the symptomatic relief of glioblastoma patients, as steroids can influence immune cell activity and affect the expression of these antigens.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it is worth noting that the study focuses on glioblastoma, a specific type of brain tumor, and the expression of these antigens may vary in other cancer types.
- CD44: This antigen is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, and its expression is critical for GBM invasion and migration. Higher levels of CD44 have been associated with poor prognosis in GBM.
- GFAP: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a marker of astrocytic differentiation and is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Its expression is positively correlated with advancing neuroglial tumor grade.
- S100B: S100B is a calcium-binding protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It has been shown to promote glioma growth and increase myeloid-derived macrophage chemoattraction.
- GSK3β: This protein is part of the PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway and is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Its phosphorylation state plays a role in glycogen synthesis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell cycle regulation.
- Tau: Microtubule-associated protein tau is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with the resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cell lines. It has also been linked to glioblastoma progression, 3D cell organization, growth, and migration.

These antigens are not only highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma but also have implications for immunotherapy and tumor targeting. For example, CD44 has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in GBM, and S100B has been shown to promote glioma growth and increase myeloid-derived macrophage chemoattraction. Additionally, GSK3β and Tau have been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell signaling, gene expression, and cell growth and differentiation, which are critical for tumor development and immune response.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET)
- 6-[18F]-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine ([18F]FDOPA)

Regarding their expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that the use of [18F]FDG for PET imaging is widespread in nuclear medicine, but its clinical use in neuro-oncological diseases is limited due to the high physiological uptake of glucose in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, resulting in a poor tumor-to-background ratio. On the other hand, glioma cells have a distinctly increased nutritional demand for amino acids to enable rapid proliferation, and unlike glucose, normal brain tissue has a low physiological uptake of amino acids, providing a superior tumor-to-background contrast.

The paper also discusses the use of positron-emitting nuclide-labelled amino acids as interesting probes for imaging gliomas in the pre- and post-treatment setting using PET. The main amino acid tracers used for glioma imaging are [11C]MET, [18F]FET, and [18F]FDOPA, all of which are taken up by the cell from the extracellular space via the Na+-independent system L-type amino acid transporter.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper mentions that the combination of PET imaging and PWI has been suggested to further improve the overall diagnostic accuracy of the differentiation of TP from TRA. A stepwise approach, where PWI-MRI is used to select cases for which PET imaging is most useful, can also increase diagnostic accuracy. The combination of exactly which PWI and PET technique is most optimal is not known and should be determined by the level of local expertise. More prospective, blinded research is needed to investigate whether PET imaging indeed adds diagnostic value when PWI is inconclusive.

- PTPRZ1: PTPRZ1 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is also expressed in other cancer types, such as small-cell lung carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and uveal melanoma. PTPRZ1 has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in both HLA-A 02-positive and negative glioblastoma. The PTPRZ1 peptides, along with other HLA-A2-restricted tumor-associated antigens, have been used to formulate a multi-peptide vaccine (IMA950) that has entered phase I/II clinical trials for gliomas. This vaccine has shown spontaneous antigen-specific T-cell responses, which were better in grade II and III compared to GBM patients.
- PTPRZ1-MET fusion protein: This fusion protein is found in grade III astrocytomas or secondary glioblastomas and is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor patient prognosis. The ZM fusion protein forms homodimers or heterodimers with wildtype MET, leading to enhanced MET tyrosine phosphorylation levels. The ZM fusion protein has been described to contain sequences encoding the carbonic anhydrase and the fibronectin type III domain of PTPRZ1 fused to the dimerization domain, immunoglobulin-like domains, transmembrane domain, and the tyrosine kinase domain of MET.
- PTPRZ1-NFAM1 fusion gene: This fusion gene has been identified in two patients with spitzoid neoplasms, associated with a copy gain in the kinase fusion gene. The protein encoded by Nfam1 is a transmembrane receptor that regulates cytokine production and is mostly expressed in immune cells.
- PTPRZ1-ETV1 fusion: This fusion has been identified in 6% of the tested gliomas, including GBMs, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and pilocytic astrocytoma. The fusion consists of the Ptprz1 promoter in frame with the highly conserved DNA-binding domain of the ETV1 transcription factor, which is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors known as oncogenic drivers in different types of tumors.
- PTPRZ1-BRAF fusion: This fusion has been identified in juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, but information on its functional significance is missing.
- PTPRZ1-VEGFA: VEGFA competes with PTN for PTPRZ1 binding, and both PTN and VEGFA seem to activate similar signaling downstream of the receptor. The monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, which binds to VEGFA and inhibits its binding to its VEGF receptors 1 and 2, does not affect binding to PTPRZ1, suggesting that the VEGF receptor-binding domain of VEGFA is not involved in PTPRZ1 binding. The heparin-binding domain of VEGFA is also not involved, and the VEGFA domain that interacts with PTPRZ1 is still to be identified.
- PTPRZ1-IL34: IL34 binds to PTPRZ1 in a CS-dependent manner, at a site or sites that are different from the PTN-binding sites, based on the observation that PTN does not compete with IL34 for PTPRZ1 binding.
- PTPRZ1-FGF2: FGF2 has been identified as a PTPRZ1 ligand that binds PTPRZ1 with high affinity. Binding was not affected by the chondroitinase treatment of phosphacan, suggesting that it takes place on the protein core of the receptor. However, this interaction and its potential functional significance in the nervous or other systems, physiology, or pathology, has not been studied further.
- PTPRZ1-VacA: The Helicobacter pylori exotoxin VacA, which is responsible for gastric injury, has been identified as a PTPRZ1 ligand. VacA interacts with the PTPRZ1 protein core sequence QTTQP at positions 747–751, which is distinct from the PTN-binding site(s).
- PTPRZ1-PTN: PTN is the first PTPRZ1-soluble ligand identified. It binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor in U373-MG cells, leading to its dimerization and inactivation of its TP activity. The result of this inactivation has been the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, resulting in an impaired association between β-catenin and Ν-cadherin, disrupted cell-to-cell adhesion complexes, initiation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tumor development and progression. In fetal human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, exogenous PTN or Ptprz1 gene deletion strongly potentiated cell proliferation mediated by the tonic activation of β-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent transcription. In renal cell carcinoma cell lines, β-catenin has been found to co-immunoprecipitate with PTPRZ1, and downregulation of PTPRZ1 by siRNA led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and a significant decrease of nuclear β-catenin, leading to decreased cell proliferation. However, in another study in human renal cell carcinoma cells, PTPRZ1 was shown to increase nuclear β-catenin protein levels and enhance cell proliferation. Overexpression of PTPRZ1 promotes the malignant transformation of oral submucous fibrosis, at least partly, through its effect on β-catenin phosphorylation. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), tyrosine phosphorylation or localization of β-catenin was unaltered following PTN stimulation.
- PTPRZ1-MK: MK, which belongs to the same protein family as PTN, was also found to bind PTPRZ1. Both PTN and MK have low- and high-affinity binding sites on PTPRZ1, and at least one of the binding sites depends on PTPRZ1 glycosylation. The PTN or MK domains that bind to PTPRZ1 have not been identified. The carboxyterminal unstructured domain of PTN has been suggested to mediate this interaction, although this has not been verified in all types of cells, and this domain has no similarity between PTN and MK. In MK, Arg78 at its C-terminal thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) domain plays an essential role in high-affinity binding to CS moieties on PTPRZ1.
- PTPRZ1-α4β1, α6β1, and ανβ3 integrins: These integrins were found to directly interact with PTPRZ1 in normal and cancer cells. The interaction of ανβ3 with PTPRZ1 in endothelial cells is independent of the presence of any ligand. PTPRZ1 also interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) ectodomain and with nucleolin, but mechanistic aspects or the functional significance of these interactions remain unknown.
- PTPRZ1-N-CAM and Ng-CAM: These cellular proteins were found to interact with the soluble PTPRZ1 isoform phosphacan in the nervous system. Those early studies showed that the extracellular PTPRZ1 domain interacts with the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and the neuron-glia CAM (Ng-CAM), but not with extracellular matrix proteins. Low levels of interaction were seen only with collagens I, II, VI, and tenascin. Specific and high-affinity interaction of tenascin with phosphacan was also found in another study. These interactions seem to be mediated by asparagine-linked oligosaccharides present in the carbonic anhydrase- and FNIII-like domains of PTPRZ1/phosphacan.
- PTPRZ1-contactin: Another neuronal cell adhesion protein, contactin, interacts with the carbonic anhydrase domain of PTPRZ1 and may generate unidirectional or bidirectional signals during neural development.
- PTPRZ1-F3: Another CAM of the Ig superfamily, F3 on neurons, has also been found to interact with PTPRZ1 on Schwann cells, affecting peripheral nerve development and regeneration.
- PTPRZ1-voltage-gated sodium channels: In brain neurons, besides cell adhesion molecules, the short-transmembrane PTPRZ1 isoform and phosphacan have been found to associate with voltage-gated sodium channels through their carbonic anhydrase domain and affect sodium ion currents. PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates voltage-gated sodium channels, and this modification positively shifts their voltage dependence, slows sodium channel inactivation, and increases the whole-cell sodium current.
- PTPRZ1-β-adducin: β-adducin was found to interact with the intracellular PTPRZ1 domain in a yeast two-hybrid system. In Hela cells stimulated by PTN, β-adducin phosphorylation is increased, leading to disrupted actin/spectrin/β-adducin complexes, and loss of stabilized cytoskeleton and homophilic cell–cell adhesion.
- PTPRZ1-Fyn: The Src TK family member Fyn was found to interact with the intracellular domain of PTPRZ1. PTN binding to PTPRZ1 in Hela and GBM stem cells leads to a sharp increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn, suggesting that Fyn is a PTPRZ1 substrate. However, in the spinal cord of Ptprz1-deficient C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and in mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells, it was shown that there were no significant differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn related to PTPRZ1.
- PTPRZ1-c-Src: Another member of the same TK family, c-Src, has also been found to co-immunoprecipitate with PTPRZ1 and is activated upon PTN binding to PTPRZ1 in HUVEC.
- PTPRZ1-p190 Rho GAP: The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho GTPase, p190 Rho GAP, has also been shown to be a PTPRZ1 substrate based on the observations that: (a) in Ptprz1-deficient C57BL/6 mice, phosphorylation of Tyr1105 on p190 Rho GAP is not affected by fear conditioning, while in the corresponding wildtype mice, it was decreased, and (b) PTN increases phosphorylation of p190 Rho GAP at Tyr1105 in B103 neuroblastoma cells in a PTPRZ1-dependent manner. In the spinal cord of Ptprz1-deficient C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Tyr1105 phosphorylation in p190 Rho GAP was independent of Fyn, supporting the notion that p190 Rho GAP is a PTPRZ1 substrate. PTPRZ1-dependent and Fyn-independent p190 Rho GAP Tyr1105 phosphorylation has also been shown in mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells.
- PTPRZ1-ErbB4: The neuregulin receptor ErbB4, which is a member of the ErbB-family TKs, has been found to functionally interact with the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region of PTPRZ1 in adult rat synaptosomes, and in cell bodies and apical dendrites of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 is increased in Ptprz1-deficient C57BL/6 mice, repressed in HEK293T cells following PTPRZ1 overexpression, and decreased in mice overexpressing PTPRZ1. PTPRZ1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 was also observed following PTN stimulation of mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells. The functional PTPRZ1–ErbB4 interaction seems to be mediated by the scaffolding membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW, and PDZ domain-containing (MAGI)-1 and MAGI-3 proteins that have been previously shown to bind to PTPRZ1 through their PDZ4 domain. ErbB4 seems to interact with the PDZ1 domain of the MAGI proteins. PTPRZ1 has been shown to dephosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated MAGI-1 and to decrease ErbB4-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of MAGI-1 and MAGI-2 in H4 human neuroglioma cells.
- PTPRZ1-GIT1/Cat-1: G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 1/Cool-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated 1 (GIT1/Cat-1) has been identified to bind to and be a PTPRZ1 substrate using the yeast substrate-trapping system. This interaction was verified in mammalian cells and the hippocampus and neocortex in the rat brain, and PTN increased tyrosine phosphorylation of GIT1/Cat-1 in B103 neuroblastoma and mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells.
- PTPRZ1-paxillin: Paxillin has also been verified as a physiological PTPRZ1 substrate based on the typical substrate motif for the catalytic domain of PTPRZ1, which was deduced to be Glu/Asp-Glu/Asp-Glu/Asp-Xaa-Ile/Val-Tyr(P)-Xaa (Xaa is not an acidic residue). This substrate motif is present in the major phosphorylation site of paxillin at Tyr-118, and PTPRZ1 was found to efficiently dephosphorylate paxillin at this site in cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was also increased following PTN treatment of mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells.
- PTPRZ1-NYAP2: The neuronal tyrosine-phosphorylated phosphoinositide-3-kinase adaptor 2 (NYAP2) has also been suggested to be a PTPRZ1 substrate. In support of this, PTN treatment of mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells increased the NYAP2 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, it was not clarified whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of NYAP2 was a direct effect of PTPRZ1 TP activity or was mediated by other PTPRZ1-related TKs, such as Fyn. Phosphorylated NYAPs interact with the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) p85 subunit and activate PI3K, Akt, Rac1, and WAVE1 signaling, many of which have also been shown to be activated downstream of PTPRZ1.
- PTPRZ1-AFAP1L2/XB130: Another adaptor protein involved in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, actin filament-associated protein 1-like 2 (AFAP1L2/XB130), is also a PTPRZ1 substrate, as shown in cell-free assays as well as in HEK293T cells. In mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells, PTN induces AFAP1L2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and this is a prerequisite for the PTN-induced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation.
- PTPRZ1-PI3K and/or Akt: Regulation of PI3K and/or Akt downstream of PTPRZ1 is one of the most extensively observed signaling pathways. In human embryonic stem cells, PTN activates Akt in a PTPRZ1-dependent manner, thus enhancing cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. In the same line, in GBM stem cells, PTN activates the PI3K/Akt pathway in a PTPRZ1- and Fyn-dependent manner. PTN stimulates oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation partly through the PTPRZ1-dependent AFAP1L2 tyrosine phosphorylation, which then leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In ovarian cancer cells, PTPRZ1 negatively regulates Akt kinase activity, in line with data on mouse Ptprz1−/− lung endothelial cells and tumors, that have increased levels of activated Akt compared to the corresponding wildtype. In HUVEC, PTN and VEGFA165 activate PI3K downstream of PTPRZ1, and PI3K is required for both cell surface nucleolin localization and cell migration.
- PTPRZ1-β3 integrin: In HUVEC, binding of PTN or VEGFA165 to PTPRZ1 leads to phosphorylation of β3 integrin on Tyr773 upstream of PI3K activation, cell surface nucleolin localization, and enhanced cell migration. Although β3 integrin expression seems to be required for enhanced migration of endothelial cells by PTN, PTPRZ1- and PI3K-dependent, c-Src- and ανβ3-independent, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activation by PTN is also required for PTN-induced HUVEC migration. Through the cell membrane functional complex of ανβ3 and PTPRZ1, PTN also activates xanthine oxidase to produce signaling levels of reactive oxygen species, required for PTN-induced endothelial and prostate cancer cell migration.
- PTPRZ1-NFκΒ: In triple-negative breast cancer cells, NFκΒ is activated downstream of PTPRZ1 following PTN binding, although the signaling that leads to NFκΒ activation is not clarified. In HEK293 cells, transient transfection with either long or short PTPRZ1 isoforms has been shown to activate NFκΒ reporter gene transcription. PTPRZ1 seems to negatively regulate the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), and in Ptprz1-deficient mice, the aberrant activation of ROCK results in enhanced long-term potentiation and learning impairments in the animal. There is also an observation that suggests that PTN targets N-cadherin for proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway in a PTPRZ1-dependent manner, but this needs to be further and specifically studied.
- PTPRZ1-ALK: PTPRZ1 has been shown to dephosphorylate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) autophosphorylation sites, an effect that is inhibited upon PTN binding to PTPRZ1 that leads to enhanced ALK tyrosine phosphorylation. However, it has not been shown whether PTPRZ1 directly interacts with ALK, and attempts to detect such interaction in endothelial cells have been unsuccessful.
- PTPRZ1-TrkA: PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates the neurotrophins' receptor TrkA, but not TrkB or TrkC, and attenuates TrkA activation induced by nerve growth factor in vivo. In the brain of Ptprz1−/− mice, tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was significantly elevated.
- PTPRZ1-TrkB or TrkC: PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates the neurotrophins' receptor TrkA, but not TrkB or TrkC, and attenuates TrkA activation induced by nerve growth factor in vivo. In the brain of Ptprz1−/− mice, tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was significantly elevated.
- PTPRZ1-TrkA: PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates the neurotrophins' receptor TrkA, but not TrkB or TrkC, and attenuates TrkA activation induced by nerve growth factor in vivo. In the brain of Ptprz1−/− mice, tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was significantly elevated.

I'm sorry, I could not find any information in the provided text about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The text does not mention any specific antigens in this context.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR: The article mentions that IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma with EGFR amplification, combined whole chromosome 7 gain and whole chromosome 10 loss (+7/−10) or TERT promoter mutation, resembles IDH-wildtype glioblastoma in the aggressive clinical course.
- CDKN2A/B: The study found that CDKN2A/B alterations were common in adult patients with pediatric-type diffuse gliomas, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- PIK3CA: PIK3CA alterations were also frequently observed in these patients.
- PTEN: PTEN alterations were another common molecular feature in this patient group.

Regarding expression levels across different cancer types, the article does not provide specific information on the expression of these antigens in various cancer types. However, it does mention that IDH-wildtype glioblastoma exhibits an aggressive clinical course, which may suggest higher expression levels of these antigens compared to other cancer types.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the article does not explicitly discuss the use of these antigens for immunotherapy or tumor targeting in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. However, the identification of these molecular alterations in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma could potentially inform the development of targeted therapies or immunotherapeutic approaches for this specific cancer type.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- PD1 (PDCD1)
- B7-H3 (CD276)
- CD44
- CD48
- NRP1

These antigens are not discussed in relation to their expression levels across different cancer types.
- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - EGFR
   - ERBB2
   - CTNNB1

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - EGFR: The expression of EGFR is often associated with high-grade gliomas.
   - ERBB2: ERBB2 has been implied as an appropriate target for CAR T cells in glioblastoma.
   - CTNNB1: CTNNB1 mutations in the ovary are characteristic features of ovarian carcinomas.

- **Immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - EGFR: The retinoblastoma RB1 gene is a tumor suppressor, and its status is identified as a determinant of glioblastoma therapeutic efficacy.
   - ERBB2: ERBB2 has been implied as a target for CAR T cells in glioblastoma.
   - CTNNB1: The expression of CTNNB1 was substantially higher in IDH1WT gliomas than in IDH1MUT, indicating a correlation with the immunosuppressive microenvironment.
- **EGFR**: EGFR amplification is a characteristic molecular alteration in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is one of the key molecular criteria for the diagnosis of this cancer type. EGFR amplification is more specific for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma than TERT promoter mutations, and it is a strong surrogate marker for the diagnosis of glioblastoma in the absence of grade 4 histologic features. However, immunohistochemistry for EGFR has poor specificity for detecting this molecular alteration.
- **TERT**: TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent molecular alterations seen in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Some studies argue that TERT promoter mutations are sufficient for the diagnosis of glioblastoma and predict poor prognosis, while other studies suggest they have poor specificity as they can be encountered at an equal or greater frequency in oligodendroglioma and melanoma. TERT promoter mutations are also associated with multifocal glioblastomas.
- **CDKN2A/B**: CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion is linked to inferior clinical outcomes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is a poor prognostic marker.
- **MGMT**: MGMT promoter methylation is a favourable prognostic marker in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, showing greater overall and progression-free survival with improved response to alkylating agents and radiotherapy. MGMT codes for O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase, a DNA repair protein that diminishes the effects of alkylating agents used to treat these gliomas.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific roles in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- CD44: This antigen is mentioned in the context of immunotherapy, as it is a marker of mesenchymal-type cells and is reduced in macroH2A2 knockdown cells. The paper suggests that macroH2A2 is involved in mediating state transitions in GSCs, and that knockdown of macroH2A2 pushes cells away from MES states and toward more pronounced NPC/OPC transcriptional states.
- PDGFRA: This antigen is mentioned in the context of tumor targeting, as it is a marker of the oligodendrocytic lineage and is upregulated upon macroH2A2 knockdown. The paper suggests that macroH2A2 represses this gene associated with the oligodendrocytic lineage by compacting the chromatin at its cognate enhancer element.
- OLIG2: This antigen is mentioned in the context of tumor targeting, as it is a marker of the oligodendrocytic lineage and is upregulated upon macroH2A2 knockdown. The paper suggests that macroH2A2 represses this gene associated with the oligodendrocytic lineage by compacting the chromatin at its cognate enhancer element.
- SOX2: This antigen is mentioned in the context of tumor targeting, as it is a marker of the oligodendrocytic lineage and is upregulated upon macroH2A2 knockdown. The paper suggests that macroH2A2 represses this gene associated with the oligodendrocytic lineage by compacting the chromatin at its cognate enhancer element.

- **EGFR:** EGFR signaling is known to activate the oncogenic PI3K-AKT–mTOR and RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathways. Exposure to EGF leads to proliferation of Olig2+ type C cells, and inhibition of EGFR signaling results in Olig2 depletion, indicating that EGFR signaling is responsible for sustaining Olig2 expression in progenitor cells. EGFR signaling activates Olig2, and Olig2 directly targets EGFR. Overexpression of Olig2 leads to significant upregulation of EGFR and transcripts. Phosphorylated Olig2 leads to differentially regulated genes associated with RTKs.
- **TERT promoter:** IDH-wildtype GBM demonstrates alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and exhibits TERT promoter mutations.
- **CD133:** CD133 is a marker enriched in GSCs.
- **CD15:** CD15 is a marker enriched in GSCs.
- **L1CAM:** L1CAM is a marker enriched in GSCs.
- **CD49f:** CD49f is a marker enriched in GSCs.
- **SOX2:** SOX2 is a marker enriched in GSCs.
- **Notch1:** Notch1 is a marker enriched in GSCs.
- **Hes1:** Hes1 is a marker enriched in GSCs.
- **Hes2:** Hes2 is a marker enriched in GSCs.
- **Nestin:** Nestin is a marker of not only CNS embryogenesis but also tumorigenesis.
- **Sox2:** Sox2 is a marker of not only CNS embryogenesis but also tumorigenesis.
- **Galectin3:** Galectin3 is a marker of not only CNS embryogenesis but also tumorigenesis.
- **PDGFRα:** PDGFRα is a marker of not only CNS embryogenesis but also tumorigenesis.
- **NeuN:** NeuN is a marker of not only CNS embryogenesis but also tumorigenesis.
- **Ki67:** Ki67 is a marker of not only CNS embryogenesis but also tumorigenesis.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I'm sorry, but I could not find any information in the provided text regarding antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, their expression levels across different cancer types, or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting. The text focuses on the treatment of unmethylated MGMT-promoter recurrent glioblastoma using a cancer stem cell assay-guided chemotherapy approach, and does not discuss antigens or their expression levels in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Choline (Cho)
- Creatine (Cr)
- N-acetylaspartate (NAA)
- Myoinositol (mI)
- Glycine (Gly)
- Glutamate (Glx)
- Glutamine (Gln)
- Aliphatic amino acids (valine, leucine, isoleucine)
- Lipid + lactate

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, as they are used to differentiate between glioblastomas and other types of brain tumors. For example, the Cho/Cr ratio is used to distinguish between high-grade gliomas and brain metastases, and the combination of a high Cho/Cr ratio and the presence of lipid and lactate peaks in the non-enhancing peritumoral area (NEPA) allows the differential diagnosis of HGGs, BMs, and PCNSLs.

The paper also mentions that the Cho/Cr peak in the peritumoral area may be affected by steroids, as a reduction in the Cho/Cr peak was observed after the use of dexamethasone in low-grade gliomas, but the changes were not significant.

Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiparametric MRI, including conventional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging methods, to provide a more accurate analysis of NEPAs in terms of therapy response to bevacizumab treatment for recurrence in HGG patients. The infiltrative tumoral area within the NEPAs is distinguished from vasogenic edema by means of PWI since high CBV, CBF, K-trans, and Vp values are associated with tumoral infiltration. Throughout the bevacizumab therapy, the increase in the tumor-infiltrative areas in the NEPAs occurs even in the absence of the growth of the enhancing tumor volume. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that anti-angiogenic therapy does not prevent the HGG infiltrative tumor progression, which can occur as an invasive, non-enhancing phenotype indistinguishable in conventional MRI from vasogenic edematous changes. However, the volumes of tumor-infiltrative edema at weeks 8 and 16 after the bevacizumab treatment initiation were correlated with the progression-free survival, suggesting a prognostic role for NEPAs in predicting the response to bevacizumab treatment.

The paper also mentions that the extent and MRI features of NEPAs were investigated to distinguish radionecrosis from progression in BM patients. The extent of NEPAs was proposed as a potential marker of radionecrosis in patients with BMs treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, as a high edema/lesion volume ratio was found to be predictive of radionecrosis as opposed to tumor recurrence. A biophysical model of NEPAs based on diffusion parameters, such as the cellular density marker, and tumoral growth from serial imaging time points, such as the proliferation rate index, was proposed to distinguish radionecrosis from tumor progression in BM patients.

The paper also discusses the use of advanced MRI techniques, such as PWI, DWI, and MRS, to distinguish infiltrative and non-infiltrative NEPAs. Infiltrative edema mainly demonstrates an increase in the perfusion parameters and Cho/Cr peak and a decrease in the NAA/Cr peak and ADC values. The accuracy of analyses increases when all these techniques are used in combination. Therefore, in the future, the radiomic evaluation of NEPAs based on multiple MRI parameters could be very useful in tumor assessment, along with large multicenter prospective studies including rigorous validation between centers and confirmation with histological data.

- EGFR amplification: This antigen is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with the paper stating that none of the institutional or public subclonal astrocytomas exhibited additional molecular features typically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, including EGFR amplification.
- TERT promoter mutation: The paper notes that none of the institutional or public subclonal astrocytomas showed additional molecular features typically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, such as TERT promoter mutation.
- Gain of chromosome 7/loss of chromosome 10: The study found that none of the institutional or public subclonal astrocytomas displayed additional molecular features typically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, including simultaneous gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- E-cadherin
- N-cadherin
- Vimentin
- ZEB1
- Snail
- Twist
- Notch

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. For example, the paper discusses the potential of developing lncRNAs as reliable GBM genetic biomarkers and the need for further research on tumour-suppressive lncRNAs as potential molecular targets in the EMT-like process in GBM.

The paper also mentions that the expression of E- and N-cadherins is investigated in almost all studies as an indication of GBM MES transition, and that developing a genomic profile for gliomas would provide a more accurate and indicative alternative to the current cadherin solution for the detection of an EMT-like process.

In addition, the paper discusses the role of transcription factors in regulating the expression and activity of EMT transcription factors (ZEB1, Slug, Snail, Twist1) which modulate the expression of the typical EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) and concomitantly induce MES transition in GBM.

The paper also highlights the importance of further validation studies to confirm the direct relation and crosstalk among factors in the signalling involved, as well as the need for more suitable pre-clinical models to elucidate these regulatory mechanisms relevant to the clinical settings.
- **EGFRvIII**: A ligand-independent, constitutively active splice variant of EGFR that promotes tumor growth and resistance to adjuvant TMZ treatment. It is expressed in about 30% of GBM and has been evaluated as a target for peptide vaccines in phase II studies.
- **PD-L1**: Programmed death ligand 1, a peculiar ligand that induces T cell apoptosis by binding to its receptor, programmed death 1 (PD-1), which is present on activated T cells mainly in peripheral organs. PD-L1 expression can be augmented by inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferons, and at the same time, PD-L1 promotes CD8+ T cell production of tumor-specific interferon-γ. PD-L1 is expressed in multiple tumors, including glioblastoma. In GBM, expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells has been linked to the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss and PI3K-PTEN-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway overactivation.
- **HER2**: Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2, a target for CAR-T cell therapy in glioblastoma. HER2-specific CAR-modified virus-specific T cells (VSTs) have been tested for safety and anti-GBM activity in patients with progressive HER2-positive GBM.
- **IL13Rα2**: Interleukin 13 Receptor alpha 2, a target for CAR-T cell therapy in glioblastoma. IL13Rα2 is overexpressed in more than 50% of GBM and not expressed at significant levels on normal brain tissue. IL13Rα2 expression seems to be more closely associated with differentiated malignant cells and tumor-infiltrating macrophages-derived suppressor cells, representing a prognostic indicator of poor patient survival.
- **EphA2**: A target for CAR-T cell therapy in glioblastoma. Promising results in terms of mitigating antigen escape have been demonstrated with HER2 and IL13Rα2-directed tandem CAR-T cells, trivalent CAR-T cells targeting HER2, IL13Rα2, and EphA2, and CAR-T cells against EGFR and EGFRvIII in animal models.
- EGFR type III mutant: The most frequently observed tumor-specific antigen (TSA) in glioblastoma, found in 20-30% of cases. Initial results were encouraging, but more recent studies have not been as promising, slowing down further development of EGFR-based vaccines.
- IDH mutations: Specific to grade 4 astrocytoma, which could be leveraged to develop a vaccine. IDH-based vaccines induce antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and humoral immunity. Clinical trials of these vaccines are still underway.
- EGFR: A potential target for immunotherapy, but its expression is not limited to IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

The paper also mentions the use of autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, which are pulsed with lysate derived from GBM stem-like cell lines. These vaccines are safe and well-tolerated, and have shown improved outcomes in patients receiving DC vaccines. However, the paper does not specify the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.

I'm sorry, I could not find any information in the provided text about antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The text does not mention any specific antigens or their expression levels in different cancer types. It also does not discuss immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of these antigens.
- GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)
- S-100 (S100 calcium-binding protein B)
- Olig-2 (Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2)
- ATRX (Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)
- TP53 (Tumor protein p53)

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text. However, they are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as indicated by the immunohistochemical data presented in the paper. The text does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
- Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT)

EGFR is mentioned in the context of immunotherapy, as it is a target for monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. TERT is not mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
- **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**: EGFR is overexpressed in most primary glioblastomas and some secondary glioblastomas, particularly in more aggressive glioblastoma phenotypes. Mutations in EGFR occur in roughly one-third of all classical tumors and often in mesenchymal, proneural, and neural glioblastomas. The article mentions that EGFR activation can be increased in various ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ways, and that EGFR is overexpressed in glioblastoma, promoting tumor growth and invasion.

- **GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)**: GFAP is an intermediate filament protein found in gliomas that astrocytes and neural progenitor cells generate. Changes in GFAP alternative splicing are linked to glioma malignancy. The canonical isoform GFAP is downregulated in higher-grade cancers, resulting in greater GFAP isoform dominance in the network. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of GFAP across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **TP53**: TP53 is one of the most commonly deregulated genes in cancer. The p53-ARF-MDM2 pathway is deregulated in 84% of glioblastoma patients and 94% of glioblastoma cell lines. Deregulated p53 pathway components have been implicated in glioblastoma cell invasion, migration, proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, and cancer cell stemness. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of TP53 across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **ATRX (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked)**: ATRX is a chromatin remodeler protein, recurrently mutated in WHO grade II/III astrocytic glioma and secondary glioblastoma. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of ATRX across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Ki-67**: Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that reflects the physiological proliferative state of the cells in which this marker is expressed. The Ki-67 labeling index (LI) increases with increasing WHO grade, and high Ki-67 expression is related to lesion volume, an increased risk of recurrence, and a poor prognosis. The article mentions that Ki-67 is evaluated using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, which stains nuclei reacting with nuclear proteins expressed in the cell cycle's GI, S, G2, and M phases. The nuclear positivity found for Ki-67 is expressed in percentage, KI-67 labeling index (LI). The article also discusses the correlation between the percentage staining of Ki-67 and overall survival in patients with IDH-WT glioblastoma, specifically that the percentage of Ki-67 staining >20% predicts poorer progression-free survival. However, there is still a debate on this in the literature, and existing papers report different results.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- MDM2
- p53

MDM2 is a protein that is upregulated in a multitude of cancers, including glioblastoma, and is associated with a poor prognosis. Gene amplification, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region, increased transcription, and enhanced translation of MDM2 may cause an enhanced degradation and decreased activity of p53. MDM2 amplification is the most frequent cause of MDM2 overexpression and occurs in approximately 3.5% of all malignancies. Up to 65% of well-differentiated and de-differentiated liposarcomas have a high rate of MDM2 amplification, while several other solid malignancies, including GBM, soft-tissue and bone sarcomas, gallbladder and duodenal adenocarcinoma, lung adenosquamous carcinoma, and ovarian carcinosarcoma, have a frequency of approximately 15%. In most tumors, MDM2 amplification is mutually exclusive to TP53 mutation.

p53 is the most frequently mutated gene across all types of cancer, with mutations occurring in about 50% of malignancies. The mutation prevalence of TP53 among different cancer types varies, ranging from less than 5% in cervical cancer to up to 90% in ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer. In lower grade (CNS WHO grade 2 and 3) gliomas, TP53 is deregulated in approximately 50% of cases, most commonly in co-occurrence with IDH1 mutations. The majority (>70%) of CNS WHO grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas harbor TP53 mutations. According to The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), TP53 is mutated in up to 30% of GBMs. While missense substitutions account for the most common TP53 mutations (~70%), other alterations, such as frameshift insertions/deletions, nonsense mutations, and silent mutations, are less common. Human cancers frequently have segmental deletions on chromosome 17p, which involves the TP53 locus. Although most TP53 mutations are detrimental (i.e., they cause a loss of function), some mutations in TP53 are innocuous, allowing p53 to continue acting as a transcription factor. There have also been reports of tumorigenic gain-of-function mutations in TP53.

The article mentions that the interaction between MDM2 and p53 has emerged as a promising strategy for combating cancer, including the treatment of glioblastoma. Numerous MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and are currently undergoing rigorous testing for their potential in GBM therapy. Encouraging results from studies conducted in cell culture and animal models suggest that MDM2 inhibitors could effectively treat a specific subset of GBM patients with wild-type TP53 or functional p53. Combination therapy with clinically established treatment modalities such as radiation and chemotherapy offers the potential to achieve a more profound therapeutic response. Furthermore, an increasing array of other molecularly targeted therapies are being explored in combination with MDM2 inhibitors to increase the effects of individual treatments. While some MDM2 inhibitors have progressed to early phase clinical trials in GBM, their efficacy, alone and in combination, is yet to be confirmed.

The article also discusses the potential of MDM2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma, highlighting the importance of the MDM2-p53 interaction in cancer development and the potential of targeting this interaction for cancer treatment. The article mentions that MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and are currently being explored for their possible use in cancer treatment, with some of these inhibitors having progressed to clinical testing. However, the article does not provide specific information on the expression levels of MDM2 and p53 across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- CDKN2A/B: The CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes are located on the short arm of chromosome 9 and encode for proteins that regulate cell growth and angiogenesis. CDKN2A/B homozygous deletions (HD) are associated with decreased survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, and the presence of these deletions is a poor prognostic factor.

The paper does not provide specific information about antigens highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it mentions the use of anti-EpCAM antibodies for detecting or enriching circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream. EpCAM (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule) is a cell surface protein that is often overexpressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma. The paper also discusses the challenges in detecting CTCs in malignant astrocytoma due to the absence of EpCAM expression in glioma cells, which is a crucial consideration for immunotherapy and tumor targeting strategies.

This pathway is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Mutations in PI3KCA can lead to increased signaling and tumor growth.
- Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 1 (PI3KR1): PI3KR1 is another component of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, and its mutations are associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

The article does not provide specific expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it mentions that IDH-wildtype glioblastoma demonstrates a complex molecular profile involving these alterations, which contribute to unchecked cell growth, enhanced cell survival, and the aggressive nature of the tumor.

I'm sorry, I could not find any information in the text about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The paper focuses on TERTp mutations in gliomas and their detection using the TERTmonitor qPCR assay, but it does not provide details about antigen expression or immunotherapy.
- **IGF2R**: Overexpressed in GBM samples compared with normal brain specimens, but no association between its expression and patients’ outcomes was observed.
- **S100A4**: Necessary for maintaining glioblastoma stem cells self-renewal; ablation of S100A4-expressing cancer cells is sufficient to impede glioma growth in vivo.
- **CCL2**: Increased in mesenchymal GBM and recruits MDSCs.
- **CCL3**: Probably responsible for chemotaxis and is expressed in activated microglia cells that stimulate glioma progression and development.
- **IRF8**: Contributes to immune evasion.
- **APOC1**: Promotes GBM tumorigenesis and is involved in lipid metabolism or immunosuppression.
- **SPP1**: A marker of glioma-associated macrophages that ensures immunosuppression and worsens survival.
- **IL10**: A driver force of tumor immune escape; this interleukin is released by a subset of myeloid cells localized in mesenchymal-like tumor regions.
- **NF1**: Loss of NF1 was found to be correlated with increased immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment and may prime cells for malignant transformation.

- PRAME (PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma)
- PRAME is a cancer-testis antigen that is expressed by melanoma cells and was isolated by autologous T cells in a melanoma patient.
- PRAME expression is used to support the diagnosis of melanoma over nevus in combination with histopathological features and other findings.
- The expression of the PRAME gene and PRAME protein can be practically evaluated by pigmented lesion assay (PLA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively.
- Although PRAME has its primary application in the diagnosis of melanoma, PRAME was also found to be expressed by various epithelial and non-epithelial cancers, including uterine carcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, ovarian carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, seminoma, thymic carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, synovial sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and neuroblastoma.
- The biological and clinicopathological implications of PRAME expression have been unknown in adult gliomas.
- PRAME has been recently introduced as a prognostic and/or oncogenic biomarker of various cancer types, including melanocytic neoplasms, invasive breast carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and hematological malignancies.
- PRAME has also been found to be expressed by various types of neoplasms as mentioned earlier.
- Regarding CNS tumors, the significance of PRAME expression has been investigated in medulloblastoma as a biomarker for immunotherapy.
- Little is known about the biological and clinical significance of the PRAME protein and its corresponding gene in glioma.
- The intensity and pattern of PRAME and its gene expression in glioma are still under investigation.
- In the present study, the authors found that most of these tumors still expressed PRAME at a low level and a minority of them, however, showed gene overexpression.
- Even with low expression, the PRAME-expressing glioma still had distinct biological characteristics, which was shown in subsequent analyses.
- Further studies to validate PRAME protein expression in glioma, using western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, or other techniques, are needed because it is not clear whether PRAME gene expression can be an indicator of its protein status.
- The nCounter Nanostring PanCancer Pathways panel was used to evaluate the biological profiles of human cancers in previous studies.
- Using this panel, the authors' PCA analysis illustrated that PRAME expression status can be a biomarker of glioma biology although further interpretations are not available in such general results.
- Pathway analysis showed more details in the biological difference among PRAME expression statuses.
- In glioma, the Wnt/β-catenin signal promotes neurogenesis and cell proliferation while the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is associated with growth, metabolism, autophagy, survival, and chemotherapy resistance of glioblastoma.
- The hedgehog signaling pathway is also required for glioma-initiating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
- These pathways were increased in PRAME-positive gliomas.
- However, various oncogenic processes or signals in PRAME-positive gliomas such as E2F targets, G2M mitotic checkpoint, reactive oxidative oxygen species, IL6-JAK-STAT6, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and mTORC1 were activated at the lower levels compared to PRAME-negative tumors.
- These results were controversial, suggesting biological heterogeneity in PRAME-positive tumors.
- Recent studies showed dozens of clinicopathological risk factors with prognostic significance in adult gliomas.
- Clinically, age, tumor size, and tumor location within CNS are predictive factors of glioma patient outcomes.
- Pathologically, histological glioma subtypes and WHO grade are also related to glioma prognosis.
- Regarding genetic abnormalities, CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, EGFR amplification, TP53 mutations, ATRX mutations, TERT promoter mutations, and 7 gain 10 loss chromosomal abnormalities are associated with poor prognosis while IDH1/2 mutations are closely related to superior outcomes.
- Regarding gene expression, a previous study developed a stemness index from the regularized cox model to predict the prognosis of glioma patients.
- Therefore, it is important to show the prognostic significance of a biomarker by adjusting such confounders in a multivariate analysis.
- In the present study, the authors found that PRAME positivity was an independent prognostic factor to other clinicopathological factors.
- Interestingly, the authors found that PRAME gene overexpression, which is more likely visualized by the protein expression detection methods, was related to a subgroup with a significantly worse prognosis than PRAME-low gliomas despite its small sample size.
- DNA methylation profile was proven to be pathologically associated with CNS tumors.
- A methylation-based random forest classifier was developed to provide a novel biological fingerprint of CNS tumors in addition to other identifiers such as histopathology and genetic abnormalities.
- Another study also argued that methylation profiling can be a reliable biomarker for further low-grade glioma subtyping.
- Therefore, examining whether there is a relationship between PRAME expression status and DNA methylation characteristics can further consolidate PRAME value in glioma biology.
- The authors' study showed that PRAME-positive gliomas were distributed more densely in the IDH-wildtype-related methylation cluster compared to the other cluster.
- Although this specific distribution of PRAME-positive tumors can be attributed to the dense clustering of grade 4 tumors, the authors believe that PRAME positivity and negativity can still be an indicator of DNA methylation profile, regardless of the causal relationships.
- PRAME can also be associated with glioma TME.
- A previous study showed that Decitabine can increase PRAME expression and, thus, enhance the T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which makes PRAME an interesting target for immunotherapy.
- However, TME of cell line can be difficult to interpret because the stromal or microenvironment context of cancer in vivo is different from that of cell line condition.
- The authors' study showed that PRAME higher expression was related to increased cytotoxic cell, macrophage, and neutrophil activity but it was also associated with many immune modulating cells such as Th2, Th17, and TFH.
- Therefore, PRAME expression is in a complicated relationship with many immunologic cell populations, not only cytotoxic T cells.
- However, there were limitations in the present study.
- First, selection bias was a potential problem because this study used a public database.
- Second, the authors' findings of PRAME positivity in IDH-mutant glioma were not significant potentially due to small samples, and, thus, sampling error.
- Therefore, a larger study of PRAME expression on IDH-mutant glioma can be helpful to examine the biological and clinicopathological relevance of PRAME positivity in these brain tumors.
- Third, protein expression data was not fully available and, therefore, cannot be analyzed.
- PRAME gene expression may be different from PRAME protein expression, which can be practically evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
- Hence, immunohistochemical studies are required to validate PRAME prognostic significance at the protein level.
- Additionally, data about histone modification is not available in TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM projects.
- Therefore, the authors were not able to analyze the relationship between PRAME expression and this epigenetic regulation.
- Finally, to the authors' knowledge, there was no available information of chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance in TCGA datasets.
- Hence, the authors were not able to investigate the relationship between PRAME expression and treatment response.
- The authors' study illustrated that a proportion of glioma did not express PRAME while the majority of glioma expressed PRAME, among which a few tumors possessed high PRAME expression.
- PRAME-positive tumors had different biological (gene expression, DNA methylation, and pathway) and clinicopathological characteristics, which were related to IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- In survival analysis, PRAME positivity, especially PRAME overexpression, was related to poor prognosis.

The paper does not provide specific information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of glioblastoma and other cancer types:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): FAP is a membrane protease that is highly expressed in many tumors, including glioblastoma, but is absent or insignificant in most normal tissues. The paper discusses the potential of FAP as a biomarker for glioma detection and monitoring, as well as its role in tumor progression.

- Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2): These molecular biomarkers play a role in patient stratification, delineation of risk groups, and prognostication of treatment response in glioma. The paper mentions that IDH-wildtype gliomas have a worse prognosis compared to IDH-mutant gliomas.

- O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT): MGMT is another molecular biomarker that influences the prognosis and treatment response in glioma. The paper discusses the methylation status of the MGMT promoter and its association with FAP levels.

While the paper does not explicitly mention these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, it highlights their potential as biomarkers for glioma diagnosis and monitoring. Further research and clinical studies would be needed to explore their role in immunotherapeutic approaches or targeted therapies for glioblastoma.

I have found the following information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed by stromal fibroblasts in more than 90% of epithelial cancers, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.
- FAP-specific PET/CT imaging has shown elevated tracer uptake in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas.
- The study by Röhrich et al. (2021) found that IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas showed elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.

The expression levels of FAP across different cancer types are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but the study by Röhrich et al. (2021) suggests that FAP is expressed in a variety of cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas, and other solid tumors.

There is no mention of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text.

I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on the role of PROX1 as a prognostic factor for patients with high-grade astrocytomas, but it does not provide details about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells.
- PD-L1: This antigen is highly expressed in human malignant gliomas, and its levels significantly correlate with the glioma grade. It is also highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with intense positive staining for PD-L1 observed in Grade IV gliomas, anaplastic astrocytoma, and GBM. The reported positivity of PD-L1 expression in GBM ranges from 61% to 88%. PD-L1 expression is controlled through the innate immune resistance mechanism by the constitutive oncogenic signaling, PI3K-AKT pathway in tumor cells.
- PD-L2: This antigen is exclusively expressed on APCs, including DCs and macrophages under homeostasis, and can be induced in a variety of other immune cells or non-immune cells in response to microenvironmental stimuli. In certain subsets of B cell lymphomas, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, follicular cell B cell lymphoma, and mediastinal B cell lymphoma, PD-L2 is highly up-regulated. The up-regulation of PD-L2 in lymphomas may result from the gene fusions between the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) transactivator (CIITA) and PD-L2.
- PD-1: This antigen is an inhibitory receptor mainly expressed on activated T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is also detectable on other lymphocyte subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells and B cells. The elevated expression of PD-1 has been detected in diverse advanced human cancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. The immunosuppressive activities of receptor PD-1 are initiated upon binding to one of its two ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, and mediated through multiple mechanisms.
- CTLA-4: This antigen is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and the first co-inhibitory molecule identified. It is not expressed by naive T cells but is rapidly induced in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon T-cell activation. The predominant functions of CTLA-4 are attributed to the effects on the two major subsets of CD4+ T cells: suppression of helper T cell activity and enhancement of Treg immunosuppression. The ligands of CTLA-4 are CD80 and CD86, both of which also signal through the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 and induce T-cell activation. Since CTLA-4 has a much higher affinity for both ligands than CD28, it effectively inhibits the ligand engagement to CD28, transduces inhibitory signals, and suppresses T-cell activation. Forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), a forkhead transcription factor, controls CTLA-4 expression. In return, when CTLA-4 is induced in Tregs, CTLA-4 mediates the down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86 on DCs, and thus reduces the potency of APCs to activate other T cells, critically controlling the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. In addition, CTLA-4 expressed by Tregs could bind to CD80/86 on DCs with high affinity, and then deliver a signal that induces IDO expression and triggers the IDO activity in DCs.
- IDO: This antigen is expressed by various tumor cells and DCs. Although not an immune checkpoint in the classical sense, IDO mediates several inhibitory pathways in various tumor types and suppresses anti-tumor immunity as a mammalian cytosolic enzyme. IDO is a tryptophan (Trp) catabolic enzyme responsible for Trp degradation through the kynurenine (Kyn) degradation pathway. IDO from tumor cells catabolizes Trp to numerous metabolites, including Kyn, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA). The maintenance and function of T cells require Trp. Therefore, the Trp degradation mediated by IDO suppresses T cell activation. Meanwhile, the metabolites, such as Kyn, 3-HK, and 3-HAA induce T cell apoptosis. In addition, when combined with TGF-β, Kyn could induce FoxP3 expression and stimulate Treg formation. And IDO expressed by tumor cells also induces Treg infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Together, these mechanisms exacerbate immune suppression associated with cancer development. In glioma, IDO expressed in glioma cells plays an important role in inhibiting T cell functions and contributes to Treg accumulation. Under normal physiology, the CNS parenchyma does not express IDO. However, 90% of GBM shows positive expression of IDO, which is further boosted in low-grade glioma, suggesting that IDO expression level correlates with the severity of glioma. Moreover, GBM patients with higher expression of IDO have a worse prognosis. However, a recent study showed that only 8% of GBM expressed IDO. Considering that the antibodies used in these studies, although different from one another, were all well-controlled for the detection specificity, these studies suggest that alternative splice variants and/or posttranslational modifications of IDO protein in GBM samples may result in antigenic variations, and thus the dichotomous findings of IDO in GBM.
- TIM-3: This antigen is mainly expressed on activated T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. It binds to galectin-9, through which it induces Th1 cell death and suppresses the anti-tumor immune response. The significance of TIM-3 has been demonstrated in different cancer models, including colon cancer, mammary carcinoma, and melanoma. In glioma patients, the expression of TIM-3 on CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells is significantly elevated compared to healthy controls, and the higher expression level of TIM-3 on T cells is associated with tumors of higher grades.
- KIRs (Killer inhibitory receptors): These are a collection of inhibitory receptors that can down-regulate NK cells' cytotoxic activity and inhibit cytokine secretion of NK cells. Many KIRs are also expressed on T cells and APCs. Activation of KIRs in T cells suppresses the cytolytic activities of these cells. Consistently, expressions of KIRs are detected in multiple cancer types and correlate with poor prognosis. Among KIRs, CD94/NKG2A is an NK inhibitory receptor expressed by most astrocytoma-infiltrating T cells. An anti-NKG2A antibody (IPH2201) is undergoing phase I/II trial testing in HNSCC patients (NCT02331875). This antibody could be applied to glioma clinical trials. Many other anti-KIR mAbs are also being tested in anti-tumor clinical trials. A phase I trial of anti-KIR (IPH2101) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia has been completed. Several studies involving anti-KIR (lirilumab) combined with anti-PD-1 (clinical trial NCT01714739) or with anti-CTLA4 (clinical trial NCT01750580) are undergoing on patients with hematologic and solid cancers. These trials will investigate the anti-cancer effect by simultaneously boosting both the innate immune activity, via anti-KIR, and the adaptive immune activity via anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4.
- VISTA: This antigen is a member of the CD28 receptor family and is mainly expressed on myeloid and granulocytic cells, including naive T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs, but not on B cells. Through the interaction with an unknown receptor on T cells, VISTA negatively inhibits T cell responses: not only T-cell proliferation, but also the expression of activation markers and the production of cytokines. In vitro, VISTA induces the development of Tregs with the help of TGF-β. In line with its biological activities, VISTA-KO mice are resistant to the development of GL261 glioma. In addition, when combined with a cancer vaccine, VISTA blockade inhibits tumor growth. In a glioma mouse model, GL261 cells were directly injected into the left cerebral hemisphere of WT or VISTA-KO mice, and the tumor growth was monitored and recorded using an imaging technique system all the time. WT mice tumors died within 35 days after GL261 inoculation, while no tumor developed in approximately 20% of VISTA-KO mice. Therefore, targeting VISTA may present potent therapeutic efficacy on glioma.

In addition, when combined with a cancer vaccine, LAG-3 blockade inhibits tumor growth. In a glioma mouse model, GL261 cells were directly injected into the left cerebral hemisphere of WT or LAG-3-KO mice, and the tumor growth was monitored and recorded using an imaging technique system all the time. WT mice tumors died within 35 days after GL261 inoculation, while no tumor developed in approximately 20% of LAG-3-KO mice. Therefore, targeting LAG-3 may present potent therapeutic efficacy on glioma.
- 2B4 (CD244): This antigen is a member of the CD28 receptor family and is mainly expressed on myeloid and granulocytic cells, including naive T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs, but not on B cells. Through the interaction with an unknown receptor on T cells, 2B4 negatively inhibits T cell responses: not only T-cell proliferation, but also the expression of activation markers and the production of cytokines. In vitro, 2B4 induces the development of Tregs with the help of TGF-β. In line with its biological activities, 2B4-KO mice are resistant to the development of GL261 glioma. In addition, when combined with a cancer vaccine, 2B4 blockade inhibits tumor growth. In a glioma mouse model, GL261 cells were directly injected into the left cerebral hemisphere of WT or 2B4-KO mice, and the tumor growth was monitored and recorded using an imaging technique system all the time. WT mice tumors died within 35 days after GL261 inoculation, while no tumor developed in approximately 20% of 2B4-KO mice. Therefore, targeting 2B4 may present potent therapeutic efficacy on glioma.
- BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator): This antigen is a member of the CD28 receptor family and is mainly expressed on myeloid and granulocytic cells, including naive T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs, but not on B cells. Through the interaction with an unknown receptor on T cells, BTLA negatively inhibits T cell responses: not only T-cell proliferation, but also the expression of activation markers and the production of cytokines. In vitro, BTLA induces the development of Tregs with the help of TGF-β. In line with its biological activities, BTLA-KO mice are resistant to the development of GL261 glioma. In addition, when combined with a cancer vaccine, BTLA blockade inhibits tumor growth. In a glioma mouse model, GL261 cells were directly injected into the left cerebral hemisphere of WT or BTLA-KO mice, and the tumor growth was monitored and recorded using an imaging technique system all the time. WT mice tumors died within 35 days after GL261 inoculation, while no tumor developed in approximately 20% of BTLA-KO mice. Therefore, targeting BTLA may present potent therapeutic efficacy on glioma.
- Cathepsin B: This antigen is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and NanoString gene expression analysis. It is also expressed in other cancer types, such as gliomas, and its expression level has been correlated with tumor aggressiveness and cancer prognosis. Cathepsin B is involved in the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix, facilitating tumor invasion and angiogenesis.

- Cathepsin D: This antigen is also highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as confirmed by IHC staining and NanoString gene analysis. Cathepsin D is overexpressed in various cancers, including gliomas, and its expression level is associated with cancer prognosis. Similar to cathepsin B, cathepsin D contributes to the invasive nature of tumors by degrading the extracellular matrix.

- OCT4: This antigen is a transcription factor critical for maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal. In the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, OCT4 is expressed in a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are believed to be responsible for the poor prognosis associated with this cancer type. The OCT4+ CSC subpopulation is considered the most primitive and may differentiate into SOX2+/SALL4+ progenitor cells.

- SALL4: This antigen is another transcription factor vital for sustaining CSCs. It is expressed in the SALL4+ CSC subpopulation within IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

- SOX2: This antigen is a transcription factor responsible for conferring stem cells with the capacity for unrestricted self-renewal and proliferation. In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, SOX2 is upregulated in progenitor CSCs and is believed to be regulated by cathepsin B and uPAR.

- Bmi1: This antigen is a protein implicated in brain development and contributes to the aberrant self-renewal and proliferative nature of glioma stem cells. Bmi1 expression is influenced by cathepsin B and uPAR, and its inhibition leads to decreased expression of SOX2.

- ATIIR1 and PRR: These antigens are components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and are expressed by CSC subpopulations within IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The RAS is a complex system involved in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis and has been implicated in cancer progression through the interaction of angiotensin II (ATII) with ATIIR1, leading to angiogenesis, cellular proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis.

- ACE: This antigen is an enzyme that converts angiotensin I (ATI) to ATII in the RAS. It is expressed by CSC subpopulations within IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is a potential target for modulating the RAS in cancer treatment.

- Tryptase: This antigen is a common marker of mast cells and is not co-expressed with cathepsin G in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

The paper does not provide specific information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their direct involvement in immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, the antigens mentioned are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells and play significant roles in tumor biology, making them potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information in the text that meets your request.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- EGFR: The paper discusses EGFR amplification and its association with higher ZEB1 labelling index in glioblastoma. EGFR is a well-known target for immunotherapy in various cancer types, including glioblastoma.
- IDH1: The study investigates the relationship between IDH1 mutation status and ZEB1 expression, suggesting that IDH1-mutant lower-grade gliomas have higher ZEB1 expression. IDH1 has been explored as a potential target for immunotherapy in gliomas.
- PDGFRA, Wnt, and TGF-beta: These signaling pathways are mentioned as regulators of ZEB1 expression in glioblastoma. Targeting these pathways has been proposed as a potential strategy for glioblastoma treatment.

While the paper does not provide specific expression levels for these antigens across different cancer types, it highlights their involvement in glioblastoma biology and their potential as therapeutic targets.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention HOXD4 as an antigen that is overexpressed in glioma tissues compared to normal brain tissues. The study found that HOXD4 expression was significantly higher in WHO grade IV gliomas (glioblastoma) than in grade III gliomas, and that high HOXD4 expression was associated with shorter survival in glioblastoma patients.

The paper also discusses the potential of HOXD4 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma, but it does not provide information on the expression levels of HOXD4 across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Nestin
- Sox2
- Vimentin

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry, which are techniques used to visualize the expression of specific proteins in cells and tissues. The paper describes the use of these techniques to confirm the expression of Nestin, Sox2, and Vimentin in patient-derived cell lines and orthotopic implantation models.

The paper does not provide information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their potential use in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- **IDH-mutant tumor cells**: The paper discusses a vaccine developed against IDH-mutant tumor cells, which is currently being tested in a clinical trial. This vaccine aims to destroy cells expressing a mutant protein.
- **MGMT promoter methylation**: The paper highlights the importance of MGMT promoter methylation as a biomarker indicating a benefit from treatment with a specific alkylating agent, temozolomide. MGMT is a DNA repair protein, and its promoter methylation is associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide.
- **BRAF V600E mutation**: The paper mentions that BRAF V600E mutations are found in a range of low-grade IDH-wildtype glial and glioneuronal tumors, as well as in malignant variants. Inhibitor drugs interrupting the BRAF/MEK component of the MAP kinase pathway have been developed and trialled in both malignant and low-grade BRAF V600E mutant brain tumors.
- **Histone H3.3 K27M mutation**: The paper discusses histone H3.3 K27M mutations, which are highly specific and considered as "driver" mutations in high-grade gliomas. These mutations lead to a global reduction of trimethylated H3K27, and the level of trimethylation at this residue is regulated by the methylating enzyme EZH2 and the de-methylating JMJD3. Experimental preclinical studies have shown that targeting these enzymes could be a potential treatment strategy for histone-mutant gliomas.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
- TERT (Telomerase reverse transcriptase): TERT is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) and is associated with increased TERT transcripts and upregulation of TERT mRNA. TERT promoter mutations are selectively observed in IDH-wildtype GBM, and the presence of these mutations is well-correlated with distinctive glioma groups. The study suggests that TERT could be a good therapeutic target against IDH-wildtype GBM, and a specific TERT-targeting therapy might be a promising strategy.
- ATRX (Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked gene): ATRX is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype GBM, as it is associated with telomere length and TERT upregulation. The study suggests that ATRX loss could be a contributing factor in upregulating TERT protein expression.
- IDH1/2 (Isocitrate dehydrogenase genes 1 and 2): IDH1/2 mutations are mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype GBM, as they are associated with the classification of diffuse gliomas. The study suggests that IDH-wildtype GBM has a dismal prognosis and could benefit from specific TERT-targeting therapy.
- p53: p53 is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype GBM, as it is associated with the classification of diffuse gliomas. The study suggests that p53 could be a potential biomarker for the applicability of TERT-targeting therapeutics.
- Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): This antigen is strongly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as demonstrated by the case study presented in the paper. GFAP is a protein specific to astrocytes and other glial cells, and its expression is often used as a marker for these cell types. The paper mentions that the neoplastic cells in the case study showed diffuse reactivity for GFAP, confirming their glial-astrocytic origin.

- S-100 protein: S-100 protein is another antigen with strong expression in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as evidenced by the case study. S-100 proteins are a family of low-molecular-weight proteins found in various tissues, including the brain, and are often used as markers for neural tissue. The paper notes that neoplastic cells exhibited diffuse reactivity for S-100 protein, further supporting their glial origin.

- Ki-67: Ki-67 is a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation, and its expression is often used as a marker for tumor aggressiveness. In the case study, the Ki-67 proliferative index was markedly elevated, indicating a high-grade, aggressive lesion. While the paper does not explicitly state that Ki-67 is an antigen, it is commonly used as a target for immunohistochemistry and may be considered an antigen in this context.

- BRAF V600E: The BRAF V600E mutation is a specific genetic alteration that results in the expression of a mutated BRAF protein. Approximately 50% of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas harbour this mutation, and it is also observed in some melanomas. The paper discusses the potential therapeutic implications of BRAF inhibitors for tumors with this mutation, suggesting that BRAF V600E could be a target for immunotherapy or tumor-targeted therapy.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting beyond the potential implications of the BRAF V600E mutation.
- **Nestin**: A class VI intermediate filament protein and a marker for neural stem cells. It is also reported as a cancer stem cell-specific marker and its increased expression is associated with higher histological grade in glioma patients. Nestin expression is positively correlated with tumor recurrence and glioma cell infiltration into intact brain tissue. In the paper, nestin staining was used to discriminate between patient-derived fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells in ring co-culture experiments.

- **Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)**: Although GFAP is not exclusively expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, it is mentioned in the paper that GFAP can also stain fibroblasts, which is in accordance with observations made by others.

- **Homeobox Protein C9 (HOXC9)**: Overexpression of HOXC9 in breast cancer cell lines resulted in increased invasiveness but inhibited proliferation, suggesting a potential role in the "go or grow" concept. However, the exact mechanisms and downstream targets responsible for its effects on proliferation and invasion are still unknown.

- **Y-box Binding Protein-1 (YB-1)**: Enforced expression of YB-1 in non-invasive breast epithelial cells induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to an enhanced metastatic potential while reducing proliferation. Similar to HOXC9, the mechanisms behind YB-1's dual role in proliferation and invasion are not fully understood.

The paper does not provide specific expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or discuss their implications in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
The paper does not explicitly mention any antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does discuss the absence of TERT promoter hotspot mutation in these tumors, which is typically found in adult IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas. The paper also mentions that TERT promoter wildtype-IDH wildtype glioblastomas have a distinct genomic landscape, but it does not provide specific information about antigen expression levels or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

I'm sorry, I could not find any information in the text about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, or their expression levels across different cancer types. There were also no mentions of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
The paper does not provide any information on antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It also does not mention any antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on genetic and epigenetic analysis of astrocytomas, and while it does mention IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, it does not provide any details about antigens or their expression levels in this specific cancer type.
- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor): EGFR is mutated or amplified in 35–45% of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and is implicated as a key driver. However, gliosarcoma, a histologic variant of glioblastoma, does not exhibit amplification or mutations of EGFR at the same frequency, suggesting there may be additional/alternate mechanisms propelling tumorigenesis and potentially mesenchymal transition into a sarcoma phenotype. The study found that EGFR amplification is uncommon in gliosarcoma, but frequent gain of chromosome 7 (72%) containing the EGFR locus was observed. It is important to note that amplification or mutation of EGFR is not necessarily required for EGFR activation. For example, copy number gain of SYNJ2 in breast cancer leads to EGFR activation by altered trafficking pathways. Therefore, even though EGFR amplification is not common in gliosarcoma, EGFR pathway activation may still be present.

- IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1): IDH1 is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and mutations in this gene have been identified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. IDH1 mutations are associated with a better prognosis in glioblastoma patients, and the study found that all cases were IDH-negative in both the glial and sarcomatous components by immunohistochemistry and IDH-wildtype by molecular testing.

- GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein): GFAP is a protein that is highly expressed in astrocytes and is often used as a marker for glial cells.

The study found that the majority of copy number loss occurred on chromosomes 9 and 10, localizing to regions containing CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes. Homozygous loss of CDKN2A is common in GBM (35–50%) and loss of this locus occurred in 14 of 18 gliosarcoma specimens.

- TP53 (tumor protein p53): TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated or lost in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that one case exhibited amplification of TP53 (17p13.1), and several regions that showed chromosome loss were areas that coded for TP53.

- MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor): MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that one case exhibited amplification of MET (7q31.2), and several regions that showed chromosome loss were areas that coded for MET.

- RB1 (retinoblastoma 1): RB1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated or lost in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that one case exhibited amplification of RB1 (13q14.2), and several regions that showed chromosome loss were areas that coded for RB1.

- PLD2 (phospholipase D2): PLD2 is an enzyme that is involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events were less frequent, and OncoScan™ detected loss of the region encoding PLD2 (17p13.1).

- MEK4 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4): MEK4 is a protein kinase that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma.

The study found that copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events were less frequent, and OncoScan™ detected loss of the region encoding Dsh (17p13.1).

- DKK1 (Dickkopf-1): DKK1 is a protein that is involved in the WNT signaling pathway and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that DKK1 is considered to be a negative regulator of the WNT pathway and has been implicated as a candidate gene that is epigenetically silenced in medulloblastoma. Loss of DKK1 may provide an avenue for WNT pathway activation with subsequent cell proliferation and survival.

- NF-kß (nuclear factor kappa B): NF-kß is a protein complex that controls DNA transcription and can induce cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis if misregulated or constitutively activated. Aberrant activation of NF-kß in glioblastoma has been reported, leading to cell invasive capabilities, resistance to radiotherapy, and even promotion of mesenchymal phenotype. Studies have been published to evaluate the therapeutic effect of inhibition of NF-kß based on these mechanisms. The study found that there is copy number loss in the region encoding for NF-kß in gliosarcoma, implying that activation of the NF-kß pathway does not play a role in gliosarcoma genesis. However, it is possible that loss of NF-kß could lead to loss of DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in neoplasia.

- TCF7L2 (TCF4): TCF7L2 is a protein that is involved in the WNT signaling pathway and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that several regions that showed chromosome loss were areas that coded for TCF7L2.

The study found that pathways associated with copy number gains included HOXA, and the pathways with the highest statistical significance involved gains of areas containing HOXA genes, specifically centered around demethylation and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), and their role in stem cell differentiation.

- Rho family of GTPases: The Rho family of GTPases is a group of proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that Rac1, a key member of the Rho family of GTPases, was a frequently identified network object related to pathways including cytoskeletal remodeling through kinase effectors of Rho GTPases.

- EGFR pathway: The EGFR pathway is a signaling pathway that is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that EGFR pathway activation may still be present in gliosarcoma, even though EGFR amplification is not common. Gain as opposed to amplification of EGFR may be sufficient for EGFR pathway activation in itself. However, it is unclear whether EGFR pathway activation is present in gliosarcoma; perhaps it is present through indirect mechanisms and not necessarily through overexpression of EGFR due to gene amplification.

- HOXA9 and HOXA10: HOXA9 and HOXA10 are proteins that are involved in the regulation of gene expression and are frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that high expression of HOXA9 and HOXA10 have been reported in human glioma cell lines.

- LPA/Rho signaling cascades: LPA/Rho signaling cascades are signaling pathways that are frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma.

- F-actin cytoskeleton: F-actin cytoskeleton is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that gains in regions coding for signaling molecules known to promote cell proliferation (F-actin cytoskeleton) and cytoskeleton remodeling (G-protein alpha-12 family, F-actin cytoskeleton) were present.

- G-protein alpha-12 family: G-protein alpha-12 family is a group of proteins that are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that gains in regions coding for signaling molecules known to promote cell proliferation (F-actin cytoskeleton) and cytoskeleton remodeling (G-protein alpha-12 family, F-actin cytoskeleton) were present.

- Actin cytoskeletal: Actin cytoskeletal is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that gains in regions coding for signaling molecules known to promote cell proliferation (F-actin cytoskeleton) and cytoskeleton remodeling (G-protein alpha-12 family, F-actin cytoskeleton) were present.

- Adenylate cyclase: Adenylate cyclase is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that gains of regions that code for adenylate cyclase were frequent and routed to pathway maps related to myogenesis and regulation of smooth muscle tone.

- PKA-reg: PKA-reg is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that gains of regions that code for PKA-reg were frequent and routed to pathway maps related to myogenesis and regulation of smooth muscle tone.

- IBP3: IBP3 is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that gains of regions that code for IBP3 were frequent and routed to pathway maps related to myogenesis and regulation of smooth muscle tone.

- Cytochrome c: Cytochrome c is a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that chromosomal gains in the region coding for cytochrome c was also present, and
- Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)
- PDK4 is a target of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and is affected by carnosine, a naturally occurring dipeptide with anti-neoplastic properties.
- The study found that carnosine significantly increased PDK4 expression in both U87 and T98G glioblastoma cell lines, while the PI3K inhibitor Ly-294,002 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin also increased PDK4 expression in U87 cells.
- The authors hypothesized that carnosine's anti-neoplastic effect may be mediated by an influence on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, as PDK4 expression is regulated by transcription factors downstream of this pathway.
- However, reporter gene assays revealed no specific effect of carnosine on the human PDK4 promoter, suggesting that carnosine's effect on PDK4 expression is independent of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.
- The study also found that carnosine reduced cell viability in both U87 and T98G cells, while rapamycin and Ly-294,002 had no significant effect on cell viability.
- The authors concluded that carnosine's anti-neoplastic effect is independent of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and suggested that further investigation of its mechanisms of action and consideration for therapy is warranted, especially given its natural occurrence and lack of side effects in the treatment of other diseases.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of PDK4 across different cancer types or its mention in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2)**: IGFBP2 is a protein that binds to and regulates the activity of insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II. It is frequently overexpressed in glioblastomas and is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor survival. The text highlights that IGFBP2-driven tumors are dependent on the continued expression of IGFBP2, and its knockdown leads to decreased tumor progression and prolonged survival. IGFBP2 is also overexpressed in the stem cell compartment of glioblastomas, contributing to tumor progression by enriching for glioma stem cells and boosting their survival. The article suggests that IGFBP2 could be a potential therapeutic target, and neutralizing antibodies against IGFBP2 have been shown to impair oncogenic signaling pathways and inhibit tumor cell spread.

- **Platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFB)**: The text mentions that IGFBP2 collaborates with PDGFB in the development of glioma, but does not provide specific expression levels across different cancer types or discuss its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **O(6)-methyl guanidine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT promoter methylation is mentioned as a biomarker of interest in glioblastomas, but the text does not provide information on its expression levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)**: TERT promoter mutations are discussed in the context of molecular subgroups of glioblastomas, but the text does not specify its expression levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma or its relevance to immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
- Nogo-A: Nogo-A is a myelin protein that is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is primarily responsible for inhibiting cell migration. It contains two inhibitory domains that bind to distinct cell surface receptors: the Nogo66 domain binds to the Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), and the Δ20 domain binds to the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Both receptors are strong activators of Ras homolog A (RhoA). The Δ20 domain of Nogo-A is a conserved disordered region that can adopt different conformations to interact with different binding partners. This flexibility enables Nogo-A to bind to both S1PR2 and SPARC, a matricellular protein that modulates the cellular microenvironment and is secreted by cells under stress conditions.
- SPARC: SPARC is a matricellular protein that is strongly expressed in highly invasive gliomas. It is secreted by glioblastoma cells in response to RhoA activation and is required for their ability to invade the white matter of the healthy brain. SPARC competes with S1PR2 for binding to an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the Nogo-A-Δ20 domain, acting as a decoy to attenuate the activation of inhibitory RhoA signaling via S1PR2. SPARC production is regulated by a novel RhoA-induced signaling mechanism that involves the deactivation of the ribonuclease IRE1α, which abolishes SPARC mRNA decay and allows glioma cells to secrete SPARC.
- S1PR2: S1PR2 is a receptor for Nogo-A that is expressed in established glioblastoma cell lines and in patient-derived low-passage glioblastoma cells. It is activated by the specific receptor agonist CYM-5520 and can be attenuated by the receptor antagonist JTE-013. S1PR2 is transactivated by the Δ20 domain of Nogo-A, mainly via its third extracellular loop, and is required for the induction of SPARC production in glioblastoma cells.
- NgR1: NgR1 is a receptor for Nogo-A that is not expressed by glioblastoma cells. Its expression is reduced in invasive glioma cell lines and human glioma tissues, with decreasing expression as malignancy increases.
- IRE1α: IRE1α is a kinase/endoribonuclease that regulates SPARC translation in a mechanism called regulated Ire1-dependent decay of messenger RNA (RIDD). It is deactivated by RhoA-induced signaling, which abolishes SPARC mRNA decay and allows glioma cells to secrete SPARC. The RNase activity of IRE1α is required for SPARC production, and its phosphorylation increases its RNase activity.
- ENTPD5: ENTPD5 is an ER-resident enzyme that enables a high protein folding capacity of the ER by sustaining UDP-glucose levels. It is transcriptionally upregulated by activated AKT signaling and is required for the production of SPARC in glioblastoma cells with high p-AKT1 levels. Inhibiting AKT1 phosphorylation or disturbing the enzymatic function of ENTPD5 prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production.
- PTEN: PTEN is a tumor suppressor protein that is often functionally inactivated in highly invasive gliomas. PTEN re-expression reduces p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels and prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production. However, not all PTEN-positive glioblastoma cells have low p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels, and WT PTEN expression in LNT229 glioblastoma cells is responsible for their low p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels.
- AKT1: AKT1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is constitutively active in highly invasive gliomas. It is often upregulated in gliomas due to genetic alterations of PI3K or PTEN. AKT1-driven ENTPD5 expression is required for glioblastoma cells to produce SPARC. Inhibiting AKT1 phosphorylation or re-expressing PTEN prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production.

The article does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
- **Collagen alpha-1(VI) chain (CO6A1)**: This protein is up-regulated in glioblastoma and down-regulated in normal tissues. It accumulates and forms deposits in perivascular tumor tissue and in pseudopalisading cells, suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis.
- **Neuron-glial-2 (NG2)**: This transmembrane chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan is up-regulated in glioblastoma and associated with a poor clinical outcome. It promotes drug resistance through PI3K/AKT survival signaling.
- **Annexin A2 (ANXA2)**: This protein is a candidate biomarker for malignant gliomas and is directly involved in angiogenesis-dependent invasion through the up-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
- **Polymerase 1 and transcript release factor complex (PTFR)**: This protein is involved in the metabolic pathways of tumor cells and is associated with the chemoresistance of glioblastoma to imatinib. It is expressed in both glioblastoma tissue and serum exosomes, and its silencing has been shown to suppress glioma progression in a murine model.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of glioblastoma, and their expression levels in other cancer types are not discussed in the provided text. Additionally, there is no mention of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Nestin: Nestin is a protein that is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and is often used as a marker for these cells. In the paper, nestin is used to identify potential tumour progenitor cells (pTPCs) in primary glioblastoma cells. The authors found that 98% of the primary glioblastoma cells were nestin-positive/GFAP-negative pTPCs, indicating a high level of expression of nestin in these cells.

- GFAP: GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) is a protein that is highly expressed in astrocytes and is often used as a marker for these cells. In the paper, GFAP is used to identify differentiated cells in primary glioblastoma cells. The authors found that only 2% of the primary glioblastoma cells showed GFAP positive staining, indicating a low level of expression of GFAP in these cells.

  - The study by Bockmayr et al. demonstrated a positive correlation between infiltrating T cells, defined by a gene signature consisting of 10 mRNA expression levels, and overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
  - The study by Ladomerski et al. showed that depletion of CD8+ T cells at a late time-point during tumorigenesis and treatment in a syngeneic murine glioma model leads to a loss of treatment effect, while CD4+ T cells were indispensable at every time-point.

- **Olig2**: A transcription factor that is highly expressed in diffuse gliomas and pilocytic astrocytomas. It is also a significant marker for glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly therapy-resistant and play a major role in tumor recurrence and invasion. The study found that higher expression of Olig2 was associated with significantly shorter overall survival in the univariate analysis of the patient cohort at the 5% and 10% cut-offs, but statistical significance was lost in the multivariate analysis.
- **Nestin**: A type VI intermediate filament that is mainly expressed in precursor neurons and identified as a marker for glioma stem cells. The study found that Nestin expression has no independent prognostic impact in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- **Nogo-A**: A neurite outgrowth inhibitor that was successfully utilized for the differentiation of oligodendrogliomas from other gliomas. The study found a heterogeneous expression of Nogo-A in glioblastoma, but no correlation with age, clinical status, MGMT-promoter methylation status, or overall survival.
- **AQP4**: A highly regulated water channel protein in the central nervous system that is frequently expressed in glioblastoma and is associated with glioma invasion and migration. The study found no differences in age, clinical status, MGMT-promoter methylation, or prognosis at different expression cut-offs.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
- Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
- Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2-A)

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as targets for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The paper also highlights the importance of understanding the molecular diversity of glioblastoma and its implications for any potential therapy, including immunotherapy.

Regarding expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that MGMT is found in 35%–45% of high-grade gliomas and is associated with a better response to chemotherapy. PTEN mutations are observed in a significant subset of glioblastoma, and EGFR amplification is also a common molecular genetic alteration associated with glioblastoma. However, the paper does not provide specific expression levels for these antigens across different cancer types.

- **CD70**: CD70 is a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, particularly in the epithelioid glioblastoma and gliosarcoma variants. It is also overexpressed in recurrent tumors and tumors with MES gene signatures of GBM, and plays a role in promoting tumor migration. Ablation of CD70 in glioblastoma cells reduced genes correlated with tumor epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as SOX-2 and CD44, and inhibited the migration and growth of the tumor. Targeting CD70Pos glioblastoma cells with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T-cells) triggered a strong antitumor response, suggesting that CD70 is a promising tumor immunotherapeutic target in GBM.
- **CD133**: CD133 is a CSCs marker associated with cancer progression and tumorigenesis in various tumors, including gliomas. In glioblastoma, overexpression of CD133 has been linked to CSCs’ self-renewal and resistance towards temozolomide (TMZ) by the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and Notch/sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathways. CD133Pos cells populations were found to be highly associated with aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1), another putative marker that promotes poor prognosis and chemoresistance.
- **CD44**: CD44 is a large cell adhesion molecule that acts as a receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA), a major element of the extracellular matrix. It is expressed with the highest expression of 55.55% in GBM. CD44 cleavage and secretion take place at a massive rate on the leading edge of the tumor, and standard CD44 (sCD44) was discovered in the opposite hemisphere of the brain, indicating that sCD44 is capable of propagating or circulating in the brain. sCD44 was shown to activate abnormal Tau pathology features, which indicates that sCD44 plays a pathological role between glioblastoma and neurodegeneration. Elevated levels of CD44 are present within the invaded location at the tumor margin, and GSCs with greater expression of CD44 in the tumor margin in comparison with the center correlates with highly invasive feature, shorter survival, and faster tumor progression.
- **CD15**: CD15 is a trisaccharide 3-fucosyl-N-acetyllactosamine, and is widely known as stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1). It has been confirmed to be prominently upregulated in various types of neutrophils and macrophages, and in several cancers. In the adult brain, CD15 was shown to be remarkably expressed on pluripotent SCs and neural stem cells (NSCs), where it is believed to play a role in cell–cell interaction throughout neuronal growth. PN subtype GSCs significantly express CD15 at the cell surface along with CD133. The expression proportion of CD15 was found to be upregulated in non-CSCs under hypoxic conditions, and hypoxia actually induced sphere formation in glioblastoma-sorted non-CSCs and those newly formed spheres are highly expressed in SC markers, including CD15. This indicates that CD15Pos GSCs can be stimulated throughout dedifferentiation under a hypoxic environment, and this interchange between non-GSCs and GSCs perhaps promotes the cancer to become more malignant.

I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.

- **FHOD1 (formin homology domain containing protein 1)**: FHOD1 is frequently expressed in glioblastoma tissue, with moderate/high expression in 84% of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cases. The expression of FHOD1 is not uniform, and can be higher in infiltrating cells than in the tumor bulk. The study suggests that the moderate/high expression of FHOD1 in a subset of glioblastomas can be considered as overexpression, as it is not expressed in brain parenchyma, although it is present in endothelial cells in the brain. However, not all glioblastomas express immunohistochemically detectable amounts of FHOD1, indicating that its expression is not crucial for glioblastoma invasion. FHOD1 has been found to be upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, and participates in migration/invasion in vitro.

- **INF2 (inverted formin 2)**: INF2 is frequently expressed in glioblastoma tissue, with moderate/high expression in 46% of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cases. The expression of INF2 is not uniform, and can be higher in infiltrating cells than in the tumor bulk. The study suggests that the moderate/high expression of INF2 in a subset of glioblastomas can be considered as overexpression, as it is expressed at low levels in glial cells according to the human protein atlas. However, not all glioblastomas express immunohistochemically detectable amounts of INF2, indicating that its expression is not crucial for glioblastoma invasion. INF2 has been found to be upregulated in basal-like breast cancer, and is associated with basal markers and functional activities.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- EGFR: EGFR amplification is a common feature of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is associated with a worse prognosis. EGFR is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies in glioblastoma, and its expression levels can vary across different cancer types.
- PTEN: PTEN deletion is associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and its loss can lead to increased tumor growth and progression.
- CDKN2A: CDKN2A homozygous deletion is a strong adverse prognostic factor in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CDKN2A is a cell cycle regulator, and its loss can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.
- TERT: TERT promoter mutation is a common feature of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is associated with a worse prognosis. TERT is a telomerase gene, and its mutation can lead to increased telomerase activity and cell immortality.
- MGMT: MGMT promoter methylation is an important predictive marker in terms of response to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, specifically in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. MGMT is a DNA-repair protein, and its expression levels inversely correlate with promoter methylation.
- CDK4/MDM2: CDK4 and MDM2 co-amplification is associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CDK4 and MDM2 are cell cycle regulators, and their co-amplification can lead to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth.
- PIK3CA: PIK3CA mutations are associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. PIK3CA is a kinase involved in cell growth and survival signaling pathways.
- BRAF (V600E): BRAF V600E mutation is associated with a better prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. BRAF is a kinase involved in cell growth and survival signaling pathways, and its mutation can lead to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth.
- Chromosomes 19 and 20: Co-gain of chromosomes 19 and 20 is associated with a better prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Chromosome 19 and 20 gains can lead to increased expression of tumor suppressor genes and decreased tumor growth.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the text provided.

- **PSMA**: PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancer and has recently emerged as a target for radionuclide imaging and treatment of this tumour. PSMA is expressed not only in prostate cancer, but also in other solid tumours including brain tumours and correlates with the WHO grade. PSMA expression was found in endothelial cells associated with neovascularization and, for these reasons, can be a very interesting marker for monitoring anti-angiogenic drugs.
- **FAP**: FAP-positive signalling of extracranial tumours is attributed to activated Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) that are located in the stromal compound of these tumours and overexpress FAP. In parallel, patients underwent multimodal MRI. FAP specific PET and rCBV MRI scans are modestly correlated and no correlation between the FAP-based PET and the ADC sequence has been observed, suggesting that FAP-specific PET could be useful in biopsy organization and discrimination between pseudo-progression and tumour progression after radiation therapy for GBM imaging.
- **TSPO**: TSPO is a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, composed of a transmembrane multimeric protein complex of 18-kDa, situated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. TSPO is widely distributed in most peripheral organs. In addition, TSPO is also minimally expressed in resting microglial cells in the healthy brain but is substantially upregulated in reactive astrocytes and predominantly during the microglia activation process, due to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. Moreover, most glioma cells express the TSPO. Different studies demonstrated a positive correlation between TSPO expression and grade of malignancy and a negative correlation with survival. The most used TSPO radiotracer is [11C](R)PK11195. Su et al. found that [11C](R)PK11195 uptake in high-grade gliomas was significantly higher than in low-grade astrocytomas and low-grade oligodendrogliomas. TSPO in gliomas was expressed predominantly by neoplastic cells, and its expression correlated positively with uptake in the tumours indicating that [11C](R)PK11195 can be used to stratify patients. Considering the short half-life of 11C-labelled compounds, other new generations TSPO specific ligands have been developed, such as [18F]DPA-714 and [18F]GE-180. In a human glioma-injected mouse model, obtained after the injection in the brain of Gli36dEGFR-LITG, Zinnhardt et al. performed multi tracer imaging PET studies ([18F]FET, [18F]DPA-714, and [18F]BR-351, this last for MMPs) to evaluate the inflammatory tumour microenvironment. Authors found that the three radiotracers only partially overlapped; glioma cells overexpressed TSPO contributing to the most of [18F]DPA-714 uptake, but also infiltrating glioma associated myeloid cells (GAMs) showed an important TSPO and MMP expression. In another study performed in patients with glioma, authors found a strong relationship (r = 0.84, p = 0.009) between the [18F]DPA-714 uptake and the number and activation level of GAMs. TSPO expression was mainly restricted to human leukocyte antigen D related-positive (HLA-DR+) activated GAMs, particularly to tumour-infiltrating HLA-DR+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumour-associated macrophages indicating that TSPO radiotracer could be useful to study tumour microenvironment. At the same time, in a preclinical model obtained with human GBM cells from patient, [18F]DPA-714 was able to detect glioma infiltration into the contralateral brain earlier than [18F]FET. In parallel, DWI MRI provides microstructure information. Authors also found an abundance of CD11b+ GAMs inside and around the tumour. We have recently developed and characterised a new TSPO radiotracer, [18F]VC701 in neuroinflammation models. Similarly, in an orthotopic glioma model obtained with murine GBM cells, the GL261 ones, we observed an earlier TSPO uptake signal compared to [18F]FLT uptake (Figure 2). Furthermore, the radiotracer [18F]GE-180 seems to provide interesting results in patients and the uptake correlates with the grade of tumour. Other radiotracers are now under development to increase the specificity to TSPO.
- **MT1-MMP**: MT1-MMP or MMP-14 is another attractive biomarker for tumour therapy and imaging. MMPs are linked to increased cell proliferation, tumour invasion, migration, and poor prognosis in glioma patients. Moreover, MMPs facilitate microglia-mediated glioma invasion by degrading the basement membrane and proteins of the ECM. Besides that, MMPs affect the neuroinflammatory milieu by modulating the expression and activity of chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and receptor turnover. Several molecules have been recently developed to study MMPs. For example, de Lucas et al. evaluated an immunoPET tracer for the membrane-type 1 matrix metallo-proteinase (MT1-MMP or MMP-14), [89Zr]DFO-LEM2/15, in xenograft and orthotopic brain GBM models. This tracer displayed the higher uptake after 24 h post injection in tumours with high expression of MT1-MMP but a severe disruption of the BBB is needed to visualise intra brain tumours. Zinnhardt and colleagues, in a multiple tracers study to evaluate the inflammatory microenvironment in an orthotopic glioma model, used the MMP inhibitor compound (R)-2-(N-benzyl-4-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)phenylsulphonamido)-N-hydroxy-3-methylbutanamide ([18F]BR-351), which binds to the activated forms of MMP-2, -8, -9, and -13. Areas of exclusive [18F]BR-351 were observed at the outer borders of the tumour volume and the area of radiotracer uptake agreed with in situ zymography, indicating elevated levels of activated MMP-2 and MMP-9.
- **MMP-2/9**: Wang et al. synthesized a membrane-penetrating cyclic peptide, named iCREKA, labelled by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and positron emitter 18F. The cyclic peptide iCREKA reaches tumour tissues via blood circulation. CREKA is expected to specifically bind to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes that are widely and abundantly distributed in tumour stroma. MMP-2/9 recognize and cleave iCREKA between CREKA and the membrane-penetrating peptide, while hydrolytic enzymes hydrolyze the disulfide bond. As a result, the fluorescent or radionuclide-labelled membrane penetrating peptide is released, which enters the plasma membrane and the tumour cells. The microPET/CT imaging demonstrated that [18F]iCREKA could target U87MG xenograft tumour in vivo from 30 min to 2 h after injection.
- **MMP-14**: Zhao et al. investigated the biodistribution and uptake of [18F]-fluoropropionyl-chlorotoxin ([18F]-FP-chlorotoxin), which binds to MMP-2 in an orthotopic rat C6 glioma model. The uptake of the tracer in the normal brain is very low and a high accumulation was found in the glioma tissue. The tumour to normal brain ratio of [18F]-FP-chlorotoxin was higher than that of [18F]FDG with the maximum uptake at 90 min.
- **MMP-14**: Kasten and colleagues designed an MMP-14-activatable dual PET/NIRF peptide probe for imaging and guiding resection of glioma. The peptide probe combined (1) a NIRF reporter and quencher pair separated by a peptide sequence (MMP-14 “substrate peptide”) that is cleaved specifically by activated MMP-14 to release the quencher and allows visualization of the NIRF dye; and (2) a chelate for radionuclides attached to a peptide sequence, that binds to MMP-14 (MMP-14 “binding peptide”) and enables PET imaging. For PET imaging the peptide was labelled with [68Ga] or [64Cu] and biodistribution was evaluated in an orthotopic glioma model obtained with PDX JX12 tumour. Both [68Ga]binding-peptide and [64Cu]binding-peptide allow to visualize PDX tumours. PET and NIRF signals correlated linearly in the orthotopic PDX tumours and the signals co-localized with MMP-14 expression identified with immunohistochemistry.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)

FAP is overexpressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of several cancer entities, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. The article mentions that FAP expression in healthy tissue is relatively low.

In the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, the article discusses the potential of directly targeting CAFs, which are made visible by FAPI-PET, with a radiation boost. This approach is suggested as a new perspective for treatment because it not only targets the cancer more accurately but also sensitizes the entire tumor to radiation, chemo-immunotherapy, and the body's own immune system.

The article also highlights the potential of FAPI imaging in early response evaluation during and after therapy. PET tracers can visualize biological and molecular changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by radiotherapy, enabling the adaptation of treatment plans and personalization of follow-up regimens.

However, the article does not provide specific information about the expression levels of FAP across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy. Further studies are required to evaluate the optimal threshold for FAP expression to specify precise tumor volume and reduce side effects of radiation therapy.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention CD44 as a potential target antigen for immunotherapy or tumor targeting. CD44 is a cell surface adhesion receptor that is highly expressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma. The paper suggests that CD44 could be a promising target for immunotherapy or tumor targeting in glioblastoma, as it is upregulated in glioblastoma patients compared to healthy volunteers and plays a role in tumor progression.
- ATRX: The loss of ATRX expression was more frequent in TERTp wild-type GBM, but this difference was not significant.
- CD133: The expression of CD133 was associated with the pattern and timing of primary GBM recurrence. It was also significantly associated with multifocal lesions.
- p53: TP53 gene mutations and/or strong immunoreactivity of p53 were found in 43.4% of patients.
- Ki-67: The Ki-67 labeling index was determined by immunohistochemical staining, with a mean of 33.8% in the study population.
- MGMT: MGMT gene promoter methylation was found in 40.5% of patients and was associated with longer PFS and OS.

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in this paper. However, they are known to be highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies.
- MET: The MET pathway can increase levels of VEGFA and VEGFR2 on endothelial cells and promote proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Activation of the HGF/MET axis prevents apoptosis through activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 kinase) and subsequent AKT activation. Upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in GBM leads to the growth and survival of uncontrolled tumor cells through the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) that activates many cell survival and anti-apoptotic genes. Another dysregulated pathway is RAS. By activating this pathway, MET can induce other signaling pathways such as MAPK, allowing tumor cells to grow and survive. Upregulation of RTKs such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can affect multiple signaling pathways in GBM. It has been found that STAT3 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) have a role in the promotion of GBM cell invasion and migration.
- VEGFA: VEGFA is a key signaling pathway in medulloblastoma, as it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Activation of the pathway has widespread and multi-functional tumor-promoting effects. HGF-activated MET paracrine signaling on endothelial cells can enhance their angiogenic activity. In the context of medulloblastoma, MET activation leads to the expression of proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factor, which are known for their important roles in tumor promotion through angiogenesis.
- VEGFR2: Aberrant expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- PDGFRβ: Aberrant expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- ErbB1-4: Aberrant expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB1-4) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- HGF: HGF is a key tumor-promoting factor in the tumor microenvironment. It has been found to be overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its expression often correlates with the malignancy grade of gliomas. The aberrant expression of MET in high-grade gliomas and embryonal brain tumors is associated with poor clinical outcomes. HGF binds to the receptor MET and induces several biological activities involved in cancer progression, such as growth, survival, motility, and metastasis.

- LBH (Limb-bud and Heart)
- SCARA3 (Scavenger Receptor Class A Member 3)

These antigens were found to be highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as indicated by the study's results. LBH is directly regulated by HIF-1 and promotes angiogenesis in human brain microvessel endothelial cells through the VEGFA-mediated ERK signaling pathway under hypoxic conditions. SCARA3 mRNA is overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma compared with breast carcinoma effusions, and it promotes drug resistance in multiple myeloma.

The study also mentions that these antigens have been reported in previous research, suggesting their potential as targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies. However, it does not provide specific information on their expression levels across different cancer types or their direct involvement in immunotherapy.
- EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)
- P53
- Ki-67

The paper discusses the expression of these antigens in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with the following key points:

- EGFR expression was positive in 84.6% of the cohort, with no significant difference between local and non-local progression groups.
- P53 expression was positive in 68.2% of the cohort, with no significant difference between long-term and short-term survivors in the non-local progression group.
- Ki-67 index was high in 36.6% of the cohort, with no significant difference between local and non-local progression groups.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
- **Interleukin 13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2)**: IL13Rα2 is a cell-surface receptor that is positively expressed in 82% of GBM samples and >70% of glioma stem-like cancer-initiating cells. It was previously thought to be directly associated with increased mesenchymal signature gene expression and poor patient survival. For the treatment of recurrent GBM, Christine et al. showed the first-in-human clinical experience for CAR-engineered IL13Rα2-specific CD8+ CTL and observed significant tumor regression.
- **Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII)**: EGFRvIII is a negative prognostic indicator expressed in about 25–33% of all patients with GBMs and is the most commonly mutated gene among the EGFR family in glioma. In EGFRvIII-expressing newly diagnosed GBM, a peptide vaccine targeting EGFRvIII (rindopepimut) was previously evaluated and found to be well-tolerated, providing immune responses with prolonged progression-free survival. More recently, O’Rourke et al. conducted a phase I safety study of autologous CAR T cells targeted to EGFRvIII (CART-EGFRvIII) in 10 patients with recurrent GBMs. Intravenous infusion of a single dose of CART-EGFRvIII cells was found to be feasible and safe, without off-tumor toxicity or cytokine release syndrome.
- **Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)**: Elevated HER2 expression has been reported in 41% of primary GBM samples and in 81.4% of GBM primary cell lines and was correlated with impaired survival. In preclinical models of GBM, bispecific CAR molecules that incorporated 2 antigen recognition domains for HER2 and IL13Rα2 showed the functional superiority of T cell expressing antigens ex vivo and in an orthotopic GBM xenograft model. However, the safety concerns of autologous CART-HER2 cells were raised by the report of a serious adverse event following the administration of 1×1010 T cells of vaccine based on trastuzumab. While administration of up to 1×106/m2 CART-HER2 cells showed no evident toxicities, unfortunately, the expansion and persistence of CART-HER2 cells was limited. To treat HER2-positive GBM, Nabil Ahmed et al. developed HER2-specific CAR-modified virus-specific T cells (CAR VS Ts-HER2) with an FRP5-based exodomain and a CD28.ζ endodomain. Up to 1×108/m2 CAR VS Ts-HER2 were infused intravenously without dose-limiting toxic effects in 17 patients with progressive GBM. After the infusion, CAR VS Ts-HER2 was detectable in the peripheral blood for up to 12 months, with no observed expansion in peripheral blood (but expansion at GBM sites). Of 16 evaluable patients, 50% of patients had clinical benefit, as defined by a partial response (N=1, over 9 months) and stable disease (N=7, 8 weeks–29 months). Despite the feasibility and safety of CAR VS Ts-HER2, a clinical strategy using it alone or in combination with other immunomodulatory approaches is warranted to improve the anti-GBM activity of CAR VSTs-HER2 by augmenting their expansion and persistence.

- Fibroblast activation protein α (FAP): FAP is a trans-membrane cell surface protein with serine peptidase activity, which is selectively expressed in activated or cancer-educated fibroblasts. It is one of the most commonly used and reliable CAF markers due to its selective expression in activated or cancer-educated fibroblasts, and functions to suppress anti-tumor immune cells, promote tumor growth, and drive epithelial–mesenchymal transition.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- CDKN2A
- EGFR

CDKN2A is a gene that encodes two tumor suppressors, protein p14ARF and p16INK4A. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A can contribute to uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation and has been reported as a poor prognostic marker in adult glioma. CDKN2A homozygous deletion is also observed in pediatric gliomas, and is a well-known hallmark lesion of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. CDKN2A homozygous deletion co-occurs with the BRAF V600E mutation, demonstrating poor clinical outcomes.

EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently amplified and overexpressed in glioblastoma. It is a well-known oncogene that plays a critical role in the development and progression of glioblastoma. EGFR amplification and overexpression are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, CDKN2A and EGFR have been mentioned as potential targets for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies. CDKN2A has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in glioblastoma, and EGFR has been targeted with monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors in clinical trials.

Predominantly the BBR2 is upregulated in cancer cells such as breast, lung, pancreas, colon, and prostate.
   - CCK is a peptide hormone that regulates various actions predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. It was initially characterized with a 33 AA sequence, but later, the peptide was shown to be present in more biologically active forms (e.g., CCK4, CCK8, CCK33, CCK39) derived from a 115 AA precursor. A total of three types of CCK receptors from the G-protein coupled receptors family have been identified, CCK1 known as CCK A, CCK2 known as CCK B, and CCK2i4sv receptor, respectively.

It has been found in various cell systems bearing NK1R, such as immune cells, monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, microglia, dendritic cells, bone marrow stem cells, and others. In the central nervous system, NK1R are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and cerebral endothelial cells. Effects of the substance P in human organism include immune and secretion stimulation, smooth muscle contraction (pulmonary, urinary, GIT, and vascular system), and is involved also in a pain transmission, vasodilatation, connective-tissue cell proliferation, and neuroimmune modulation.
   - VIP is a peptide with a 28 AA sequence that regulates various immune cells, promotes vasodilatation, growth, and function of tumor cells. Its biological action is mediated through three classes of the G-protein-coupled receptors VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1. The receptors for VIP occur in numerous tumor cells, including thyroid, breast, lung, liver, pancreas, intestinal epithelial cells, colon, bladder, prostate, uterus, and neuroendocrine tumors.
I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- SOCS3: SOCS3 is a protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and is associated with chemo- and radioresistance in glioblastoma. The study found that elevated SOCS3 expression is positively correlated with increased neovascularization in glioblastoma samples.
- VEGFA: VEGFA is an angiogenic cytokine that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and is associated with GBM prognosis. The study found that VEGFA expression levels are correlated with SOCS3 expression levels, and that the three-gene transcriptome signature of SOCS3, VEGFA, and TEK can be used to predict the prognosis of all GBM subclasses.
- TEK: TEK is a receptor that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and is associated with GBM prognosis. The study found that TEK expression levels are correlated with SOCS3 and VEGFA expression levels, and that the three-gene transcriptome signature of SOCS3, VEGFA, and TEK can be used to predict the prognosis of all GBM subclasses.

The study also mentions that these antigens are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and are associated with GBM prognosis. However, there is no specific information provided about their expression levels across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, nor does it mention any information on their expression levels across different cancer types. However, it does discuss the expression of certain antigens in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting.

The paper mentions the following antigens:
- O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
- Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
- Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
- Phosphate and tension homology on chromosome 10 (PTEN)
- Ki-67
- TP53

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, but the paper does discuss their expression in glioblastoma and their potential role in distinguishing pseudoprogression from true early progression. For example, the paper states that MGMT promoter methylation status can predict the incidence and outcome of pseudoprogression after concomitant radiochemotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. The paper also mentions that the expression of EGFR, MMP-9, and VEGF is associated with tumor progression and that PTEN expression is associated with tumor suppression.

The paper does not provide any information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it does mention that the expression of these antigens is associated with specific molecular and histological characteristics of glioblastoma, which could potentially be used to distinguish pseudoprogression from true early progression.
- B7-H3 (CD276): This antigen is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 14.07 (1.02) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 12.35 (0.87) in unmethylated cases. B7-H3 is a costimulatory molecule for T cell activation and IFN-γ production, and its expression is associated with lower overall survival in high-grade glioma.
- PD-L1: PD-L1 expression is significantly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 11.50 (0.57) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 10.62 (0.58) in unmethylated cases. PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 on T-cells, potentially suppressing T-cell activation. Its expression is also associated with increased PD-L1 inhibitor (nivolumab) use in clinical practice.
- CD4: CD4 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 11.22 (0.65) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 9.58 (1.01) in unmethylated cases. CD4 is a T-helper cell marker, and its increased expression may indicate higher levels of T-helper cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD14: CD14 expression is significantly elevated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 12.58 (1.61) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 9.47 (1.46) in unmethylated cases. CD14 is a marker for monocytes and macrophages, and its increased expression may suggest a higher presence of these immune cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD68: CD68 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 12.97 (1.00) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 11.14 (0.80) in unmethylated cases. CD68 is a marker for macrophages and microglia, and its increased expression may indicate a higher presence of these cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD8A: CD8A expression is significantly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 8.30 (0.78) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 6.90 (0.66) in unmethylated cases. CD8A is a cytotoxic T-cell marker, and its increased expression may suggest a higher presence of cytotoxic T-cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD19: CD19 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 7.77 (0.74) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 6.66 (0.63) in unmethylated cases. CD19 is a B-cell marker, and its increased expression may indicate a higher presence of B-lymphocytes in the tumour microenvironment.
- FOXP3: FOXP3 expression is significantly elevated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 7.94 (0.73) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 7.02 (0.51) in unmethylated cases. FOXP3 is a unique transcriptional repressor protein expressed by T-regulatory cells, and its increased expression may suggest a higher presence of T-regulatory cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD44: CD44 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 15.58 (1.24) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 13.30 (1.60) in unmethylated cases. CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. Its increased expression may be associated with tumour progression and metastasis.
- STAT3: STAT3 expression is significantly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 12.85 (1.44) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 13.24 (0.87) in unmethylated cases. STAT3 is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Its increased expression may be associated with tumour progression and resistance to therapy.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- B-Raf
- BRAF
- BRAFV600E
- BRAFnon-V600E
- IDH1/2
- IDH1
- IDH2
- ATRX
- TP53
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the following information on their expression levels across different cancer types:

- B-Raf is a serine-threonine kinase in the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which transduces mitogenic stimuli after the activation by growth factor receptors that are involved in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. MAPK pathway activation is common in various neoplasms, and active RAS mutations have been detected in approximately 15% of malignant human tumors.
- Compared with ARAF and RAF1, BRAF plays a critical role in kinase activity. A previous study showed that RAF1 is activated by BRAF through direct interactions between proteins and phosphorylation. BRAF participates in the pathological mechanism of 7% of human neoplasms, especially in patients with melanoma and colorectal, thyroid, and lung cancer. The expression of BRAF is highly restrained, and the high expression of BRAF in neural cells indicates that it is a vital MEK kinase in neuronal tissues. BRAF mutations are found in some central nervous system neoplasms. In pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs), these alterations correlate with oncogenic senescence, which may contribute to an improved prognosis. The BRAFV600E mutation is rare in adult LGGs and glioblastomas and can only be found in 1 to 5% of samples. While BRAF activation contributes to tumor development and progression in the neural stem cells and progenitor cells of Homo sapiens, BRAF mutations are detected in adult diffuse gliomas and are associated with poor outcomes.
- Most studies have focused on the BRAFV600E mutation, although more than 70 BRAF mutations have been reported to date. Mutations in BRAF at V600 can activate ERK, which plays a critical role in the G1/S transition by adjusting the expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, and p21Cip1. The BRAFV600E mutation is the most potent MAPK pathway activator, whereas BRAFnon-V600E mutations are low-activity kinases that slightly stimulate the MAPK pathway. However, these low-activity BRAF mutants could activate MAPK signaling in COS-1 cells to a high level by activating RAF1.
- Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a frequent mutation associated with a survival benefit in glioma patients and it has been defined as a molecular parameter to define the categories of brain tumors in the updated 2016 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS). IDH1 and BRAFV600E mutations are associated with infiltrative gliomas or circumscribed gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, respectively, and they are exclusive in most cases. The exact effect of BRAF non-V600E and BRAFV600E on the prognosis of glioma patients and whether there are unique molecular characteristics in their MAPK and p53 pathways remain largely unknown.
- In this study, co-occurring mutations and copy number alterations of 35 associated genes in the MAPK and p53 pathways were retrieved and investigated, and the prognosis of the available adult glioma cohorts with BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E were evaluated by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database. The authors determined that BRAFnon-V600E exhibited a stronger association with the IDH1/2 mutation than BRAFV600E, but no survival advantage was found.
- The study populations were divided into two groups, BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E. The major demographic characteristics and clinical data of the two groups are summarized in Table 2. The patients’ ages ranged from 20 to 85 years and were divided into early adulthood, midlife, mature adulthood, and late adulthood (aged 20–35, 35–50, 50–80, and >80 years, respectively). The two groups had comparable proportions of male patients, diagnosis age, cancer type, and overall survival status. Glioblastoma multiform was the most common cancer type in both cohorts (74.07% vs. 56.00%; P=0.175; Table 2).
- The mutation frequencies of KRAS, HRAS, RAF1, MAP 3K1, MAP 2K1, MAP 2K2, MAP 2K4, MDM2, MDM4, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B were comparable between the two groups. In contrast, the BRAFnon-V600E group exhibited a significantly higher mutation frequency of TP53 (56.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.001), IDH1/2 (36.00% vs. 3.70%; P=0.015), and ATRX (32.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.037) than the BRAFV600E group. The variables with P<0.10 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the BRAFnon-V600E group exhibited a significantly higher TP53 mutation frequency (56.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.031) than the BRAFV600E group (Table 3).
- There were no available copy number data for five patients with BRAFV600E and five patients with BRAFnon-V600E. The copy number alterations of the available co-occurring genes included BRAF, RAF1, MAP 3K1, MAP 2K1, MAP 2K2, MAP 2K4, MAPK1, MAPK3, TP53, MDM2, MDM4, TP53BP1, IDH1, IDH2, ATRX, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B. The HD copy number was frequently retrieved for these two genes, including CDKN2A and CDKN2B (Fig. 2), and the HD of both CDKN2A (77.27.00% vs. 60.00%; P=0.032) and CDKN2B (77.27.00% vs. 60.00%; P=0.032) was more frequent in the BRAFV600E cohort than in the BRAFnon-V600E cohort (Table 4).
- The estimated mean survival time was 51.394 months for patients with BRAFV600E, 89.958 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E, 44.500 months for patients with BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT, and 93.821 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT. There was no difference between the survival of BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E (51.394 vs. 89.958, chi-square 1.130, P=0.288). In addition, there was no difference between the survival of BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT and BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT (44.500 vs. 93.821, chi-square 0.007, P=0.935), which excluded the survival benefit of IDH1/2. The authors also evaluated the survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop and activation segment. The estimated survival time of these two subgroups was 12.250 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop and 34.800 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the activation segment. In addition, there was no difference between the BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT cohorts and those of the BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT cohorts. As shown below, BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT vs. BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT had mutations in the G-loop (44.500 vs. 12.250, chi-squared 0.122, P=0.727), and BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT vs. BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT had mutations in the activation segment (44.500 vs. 34.800, chi-square 0.145, P=0.703). Since the estimated mean survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop was the shortest, the authors compared the BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop with the remaining BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT patients. There was no difference between them (12.250 vs. 95.100, chi-square 0.008, P=0.927) (Fig. 3). The numbers at risk of Kaplan–Meier survival curves were shown in Supplementary Dataset S2.
- The authors propose that a larger sample is necessary for confirmation of this finding. Their data indicated that the BRAFnon-V600E cohort had no survival advantage from co-occurrence with IDH mutations compared with the BRAFnon-V600E cohort of adult patients with glioma.
- The authors conclude that in adult patients with gliomas, BRAFnon-V600E, rather than BRAFV600E, frequently co-occurs with TP53, IDH1/2, and ATRX mutations. Both BRAFnon-V600E and BRAFV600E frequently overlapped with CDKN2A/2B HDs, whereas there were no significant differences between the two cohorts. Although there were significant differences in co-occurring gene mutations and copy number alterations, no difference was found in survival between cohorts of BRAFnon-V600E and BRAFV600E with and without IDH1/2 favorable effects on survival. They also found that the estimated mean survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop was the shortest; however, no difference was observed between that cohort and other cohorts. Due to the poor available mRNA and protein data in the TCGA database they retrieved in this study, no expression data were evaluated. More clinical data or models are necessary to elucidate the mechanism involved in BRAFnon-V600E-associated glioma in the future.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- MARCO: MARCO is a scavenger receptor normally found on alveolar macrophages with a variety of immunomodulatory roles. It is highly expressed on a subpopulation of macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but not in IDH-mutant GBM or lower-grade gliomas. MARCO expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes and the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. The mesenchymal nature of MARCO is supported by its role in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition outside the context of cancer. MARCO+ macrophages demonstrate loss of inflammatory pathways and antigen presentation, and are recruited from the blood via the upregulation of a set of factors secreted by tumor cells, including CSF1 and TGF-β. Anti-MARCO therapeutic antibodies have demonstrated efficacy in mouse melanoma models, and MARCO expression changes in the course of anti-PD1 immunotherapy, with responders exhibiting decreases in MARCO in the long term following treatment.
- CSF1: CSF1 is a macrophage colony-stimulating factor that is upregulated in tumor cells and is associated with higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. CSF1 expression in tumor cells has been previously shown to be related to higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. CSF1R inhibitors are a potential therapeutic option for targeting TAMs.
- TGF-β: TGF-β is a growth factor that is upregulated in tumor cells and is associated with higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. TGF-β has been experimentally shown to upregulate MARCO expression in M0 BMDMs, joining a host of other studies implicating TGF-β in glioma progression.

These antigens are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells and are associated with poor clinical outcomes and the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. They are also involved in the recruitment of macrophages from the blood and have been targeted in immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- FAP is a member of the dipeptidyl peptidase family, which has catalytic activity and is engaged in protein recruitment and scaffolds.
- Recent studies have found that FAP expression in different types of cells within the GBM microenvironment is typically upregulated compared with that in lower grade glioma and is most pronounced in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM.
- As a marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with tumorigenic activity, FAP has been proven to promote tumor growth and invasion via hydrolysis of molecules such as brevican in the extracellular matrix and targeting of downstream pathways and substrates, such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21).
- In addition, based on its ability to suppress antitumor immunity in GBM and induce temozolomide resistance, FAP may be a potential target for immunotherapy and reversing temozolomide resistance; however, current studies on therapies targeting FAP are still limited.
- In this review, the authors summarized recent progress in FAP expression profiling and the understanding of the biological function of FAP in GBM and raised the possibility of FAP as an imaging biomarker and therapeutic target.
- They found that FAP is expressed in various cell types within the GBM microenvironment, including GBM cells, stromal mesenchymal cells, pericytes, and GBM-derived endothelial cells.
- FAP plays a protumorigenic role in GBM and other solid tumors, and its enzymatic and nonenzymatic activity has been investigated in other solid tumors, suggesting possible exploration directions for FAP in GBM.
- Several substrates of FAP have been identified, including collagen I and III, FGFR21, and NPY, and the functional roles of FAP enzymatic activity have also been investigated.
- Via enzymatic cleavage of its substrates, FAP plays an important role in extracellular matrix modulation, infiltrated macrophage education, metabolic regulation, and tumor promotion; therefore, inhibiting the enzymatic activity of FAP may be a potential strategy of antitumor therapy.
- In GBM, several of the mentioned substrates were investigated, and possible functional roles of FAP in GBM were also proposed.
- The authors discussed the current knowledge of FAP roles in GBM, including tumor proliferation and invasion, angiogenesis, immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, EMT, and TMZ resistance.
- They also explored the future clinical applications of FAP, including FAP as a potential imaging biomarker, prognostic value of FAP, and advances in FAP-targeted therapy.
- The authors concluded that current studies have discovered upregulated FAP expression in GBM and proposed potential roles of FAP in GBM which are not yet well characterized in GBM; however, preclinical studies have shown the potential of FAP in clinical practice, while more investigation is needed to fulfill our understanding of FAP functional roles and overcome the challenges we are facing to improve FAP targeted therapy in GBM.

These techniques involve the use of high-frequency stimulation and the measurement of various neurophysiological parameters, such as motor threshold, MEP amplitude, and latency.

- Immunotherapy and tumor targeting: The paper does not discuss the use of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. However, it does mention the potential for the advanced motor mapping technique to be used as a tool to investigate M1 functional neuroplasticity, which could have implications for the development of new treatments for brain cancer.

- **IGFBP2:**
   - IGFBP2 is one of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) and is involved in lymphocyte proliferation.
   - It is expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has been explored as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various autoimmune diseases.
   - IGFBP2 expression is associated with the survival of GBM patients, with higher expression predicting shorter survival.
   - The article suggests that IGFBP2 expression may be a useful marker for GBM prognosis.
- **NOD2:**
   - NOD2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including oral lichen planus, Crohn's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.
   - It is expressed at higher levels in activated/memory CD4+ T cells and has been proposed as a diagnostic and treatment target for certain diseases.
   - A prognostic model for GBM patients was constructed using 9 immune genes, including NOD2, which predicted shorter survival.
- **TCF3:**
   - TCF3 is a transcription factor that contributes to the proliferative phenotype in Burkitt lymphoma and promotes B-cell-restricted genes through E-box motifs.
   - It can promote the survival of Burkitt's lymphoma cells by activating B-cell receptor signaling and PI3K signaling pathways and modulating cell cycle regulators.
   - TCF3 also promotes survival in lymphoid cells.
- **TYRO3:**
   - TYRO3 is a protein-coding gene involved in the ERK signaling pathway.
   - Higher levels of TYRO3 expression are associated with decreased overall survival in patients with colorectal, hepatocellular, and breast cancers.
   - While TYRO3 has not been directly linked to GBM, its prognostic value in this context should be further investigated.
- **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**: EGFR is frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma, with amplification and overexpression associated with poor prognosis, especially in young patients. EGFR amplification is closely associated with wild-type IDH1/2, and EGFR overexpression is significantly elevated in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM samples. However, EGFR amplification is not a significant prognostic factor for IDH1/2-wild-type GBM patients.
- **LANCL2 (Lanthionine Synthetase C-Like 2)**: LANCL2 is a homologue of prokaryotic LanC, involved in lantibiotics synthesis. It is a receptor for abscisic acid, an endogenous mammalian hormone, and can increase tumor cell sensitivity to adriamycin. LANCL2 amplification is an independent prognostic factor for younger glioblastoma patients, but not for IDH1/2-wild-type GBM patients.
- **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)**: TERT promoter mutation is found in approximately 80% of primary GBM patients and is associated with poor survival. However, there is no specific mention of TERT expression levels in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM.
- **TP53**: TP53 mutation is associated with glioblastoma, but there is no specific information about its expression levels in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM.
- **MGMT (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)**: MGMT promoter methylation is a prognostic marker in glioblastoma, but there is no direct correlation between MGMT expression and IDH1/2-wild-type status.

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text. However, EGFR and LANCL2 are extensively studied in glioblastoma, and their amplification and overexpression are potential diagnostic and prognostic markers. TERT, TP53, and MGMT are also important molecular markers in glioblastoma with prognostic significance.
- Fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP) is a type II integral serine protease that is specifically expressed by activated fibroblasts.
- FAP is overexpressed in many tumor tissues, including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, lung, brain, intrahepatic bile duct, and ovarian cancers.
- FAP is a marker that is constitutively expressed on the mesenchymal cells of most epithelial solid tumors.
- FAP expression promotes tumor occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis, which worsens the patient’s condition and is associated with a poor prognosis.
- FAP-targeted drugs can exert curative effects in models of most solid tumors.
- Nanomaterials have been used to target FAP for diagnosing and treating tumors.
- Nanomaterials have special properties that produce quantum size, interface, and macroscopic quantum tunneling effects, which can induce different biological responses.
- Nanomaterials have high surface reaction activity, many active centers, high catalytic efficiency, and strong adsorption capacity, which may have broad applications in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors.
- Some fluorescently labeled nanomaterials also have a significant role in tumor diagnosis and treatment, particularly those emitting second near-infrared channel (NIR-II) region fluorescence.
- Fluorescence imaging in the NIR-II region is at the forefront of biomedical research due to its inherent advantages, including relatively lower tissue autofluorescence and higher spatiotemporal resolution.
- Certain nanomaterials are constructed out of materials that respond to enzyme activity, and consequently, turn on quenched fluorescence under the catalysis of enzymes to obtain clear images.
- Targeted drugs and nanodrugs based on antibodies to FAP have been developed.
- Early studies of monoclonal antibodies targeting FAP focused on identifying FAP and F19 without considering their potential therapeutic effects. However, radiolabeled F19 revealed high expression of FAP in tumors and metastases, with improved clinical symptoms, which supports potential diagnostic and therapeutic roles for antibodies targeting FAP.
- Cheng et al. reported that antibody treatment targeting FAP inhibits tumor growth. Specifically, they immunized rabbits with recombinant mouse FAP and collected the resulting serum with FAP-specific antibodies. Treatment with this serum significantly inhibited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines transplanted into nude mice.
- Specific anti-FAP antibodies and single-chain variable fragments (scFv) against FAP were subsequently developed, and the results revealed that the human single-chain fragments (scFv18 and scFv34) have greater affinity and lower immunogenicity, relative to F19.
- As macromolecular antibodies cannot easily enter solid tumors and produce a curative effect, Schmidt et al. constructed a bivalent FAP-specific antibody through targeted selection and reported an increased affinity for tumor tissue and human-derived VL and VH chains.
- Results from a phase I clinical study and pharmacokinetic analysis of the humanized anti-FAP antibody (sibrotuzumab) further revealed that it is well tolerated in humans and is specifically concentrated in the tumor stroma, with limited absorption in normal tissues.
- Millul et al. described a ligand with ultra-high affinity for FAP (OncoFAP) that is used for precise diagnosis and treatment of FAP+ tumors. Through the addition of fluorescein, which facilitates quantification of drug aggregation, they observed that 10 minutes after intravenous injection of OncoFAP, more than 30% of the drug had accumulated in 1 g of the tumor, maintaining a high concentration for at least 3 h, ensuring a long diagnostic time window. Furthermore, certain drugs can be tagged with fluorescein, allowing for simultaneous treatment and diagnosis.
- Ruger et al. combined liposomes containing DY-676-COOH with antibodies of FAP (scFv) to prepare anti-FAP liposomes (anti-FAP-IL). After the synthesis, the fluorescence of near-infrared fluorescent dyes in the aqueous solution within the liposomes was quenched, and only FAP-expressing cells were able to take up and activate fluorescence, which improves the diagnostic accuracy of the tumor.
- Li et al. reported a nanoparticle-based photodynamic therapy involving a photosensitizer (ZnF16Pc) encapsulated in a ferritin nanocage. The nanocage was conjugated with scFv to permit FAP targeting, and phototherapy was then used to eliminate the targeted cells. Targeting CAFs effectively treated tumors in mice. An analysis of intratumoral aggregation at different nanoparticle sizes revealed that nanoparticles in the tumors had enhanced permeability and retention, although most nanoparticles were distributed in the area around blood vessels and did not migrate to the tumor’s center. This was largely related to the physical barrier that was created by the dense tumor extracellular matrix, which prevented effective nanoparticle extravasation and diffusion. Thus, targeting and eliminating CAFs promotes the aggregation of nanoparticles in the tumors.
- Zhen et al. evaluated a similar nano-photoimmunotherapy strategy using drug-bearing nanocages conjugated with scFv to target FAP, which effectively eliminated CAFs through phototherapy with negligible damage to healthy tissues. Although this method did not directly target cancer cells, it effectively reduced tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Further studies revealed that targeting CAFs leads to decreased CXCL12 release and decreased extracellular matrix deposition, which reduces the barrier to T-cell infiltration and facilitates greater tumor inhibition. Thus, targeting FAP in this context might help regulate the tumor microenvironment and permit a more effective anti-tumor immune response.
- Lang et al. built a CAF-targeted siRNA delivery system by loading FAP antibodies onto cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-based nanoparticles. The nanoparticles can specifically down-regulate the expression of CXCL12 in CAFs, significantly inhibiting tumor cell invasion and migration, and tumor angiogenesis.
- Due to the special morphology of nanomaterials, more antibodies are attached to the surface, which improves the possibility of binding to FAP and greatly enhances the targeting ability.
- Prodrugs and nanodrugs based on FAP dipeptidase activity have been developed. The general structure of the prodrug is Z-Gly-Pro-Drug. It has a small molecular weight, and its toxicity is lower than that of the original drug. It exerts its effect after hydrolysis of the FAP-positive site.
- Diagnosis based on the high expression characteristics of FAP in tumor tissues, fluorescent probes and combined prodrug probes that respond to FAP enzyme activity have been designed to diagnose tumors. The use of the above probes has been only tested in animal tumor models for the time being.
- Han et al. developed a nanodrug with FAP endonuclease as a switch based on polydopamine-coated gold nanostar (GNS@PDA). This nanoplatform can essentially perform computed tomography/photoacoustic/two-photon luminescence/infrared thermal four-modality imaging. Under the precise guidance of multi-mode imaging, GNS@PDA performs uniform photothermal ablation of large solid tumors. These results show the great potential of this scalable nanoplatform related to FAP in cancer treatment.
- Ji et al. developed nanocarriers containing FAP cleavable peptides. These particles can hold drugs or fluorescent dyes and can release loaded drugs and fluorescent dyes under the action of FAP endonuclease, so they can be used as drug delivery platforms and cancer tissue imaging tools. Due to the high loading rate of nanodrugs, in most cases, integrated diagnosis and treatment research will likely be carried out, which can achieve the effect of killing two birds with one stone.
- Zhao et al. constructed a near-infrared probe based on FAP reactive peptides, which spontaneously form a large quantity of nanofibers on the surface of CAFs. In vitro imaging revealed that tumors were detectable at 24 h after probe administration and that the tumor group had a 5.5-fold greater signal than the control group. The probe provides a window of > 48 h for detecting a tumor and the selective probe assembly permits differentiation between tumors and organs with high metabolic activity, as the probe produces a tumor-specific signal that is 4-fold greater than the liver signal and 5-fold greater than the kidney signal. Moreover, the probe could specifically, and sensitively, diagnose small tumors with a diameter of approximately 2 mm.
- Therapies considering that FAP is overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment and generally absent in healthy adult tissues, some research groups have sought to use FAP protease activity to selectively activate prodrugs at tumor sites to improve effectiveness and reduce toxicity. Most candidates are prodrugs that are modified using nanotechnology, although they have not been tested in clinical trials. A mouse breast cancer model revealed that epirubicin conjugated with a FAP-specific dipeptide (Z-Gly-Pro) effectively releases epirubicin after incubation with FAP, and epirubicin induces a substantial anti-tumor effect in cells with high FAP expression (4T1). Furthermore, relative to free epirubicin, mice treated with this nanomaterial exhibit less weight loss with no obvious cardiotoxic effects. Other mouse and dog models have revealed that doxorubicin conjugated to a FAP substrate has significantly lower toxicity and greater safety relative to the toxic effects of free doxorubicin on the heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Moreover, the same dose of the doxorubicin-conjugated formulation is associated with a 2-fold increase in intratumor accumulation. In the clinical trial stage, it was found that Z-Gly-Pro-Dox is difficult to dissolve in water. Zhang et al. designed a nanomicelle system (ZGD-MNs) to promote the systemic administration of Z-Gly-Pro-Dox. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was used to evaluate its distribution in rats. The study found that ZGD-MNs are reasonably stable in phosphate buffer, showing good physical and chemical stability during the observation period of 2 weeks, and the cumulative drug release rate within 24 h was over 56%. Ji et al. have designed a new cleavable amphiphilic peptide that specifically responds to FAP on the surface of CAFs. The peptide spontaneously assembles into fibrous nanostructures in solution, which can easily be converted into drug-loaded spherical nanoparticles. These nanoparticles break down in response to FAP activity, resulting in rapid and effective drug release at the tumor site.
- Deep delivery of nanodrugs in tumor tissues the performance of many anti-cancer drugs is largely hindered by insufficient penetration. However, the variability of the particle size in nanomedicine allows for better dispersion and infiltration after entering the tumor tissue. In addition, targeting FAP to induce CAFs damage can also increase the penetration depth of the drug in the tumor tissue. Hou et al. have proposed a self-assembling FAP-triggered drug delivery system composed of peptide-crosslinked cationic polyaminoamine dendrimers. The chemotherapeutic drug (docetaxel) is conjugated to the peptide-crosslinked cationic polyaminoamine through disulfide bonds and electrostatic interactions and also coupled to hyaluronic acid to improve tumor targeting and biocompatibility. The nanoparticles have a diameter of approximately 200 nm and negative zeta potential, which permits stable circulation in the blood. However, when exposed to FAP, the nanoparticles dissociate and release the chemotherapeutic drug, which can penetrate CAFs and tumor cells. Studies have confirmed that the nanomaterial has good penetration of tumor-related biological barriers while killing a large number of tumor cells and a smaller number of CAFs. This effect is associated with a good therapeutic effect in hyperplastic solid tumors in connective tissues. Yan et al. have previously designed a light-triggered large-size nanoparticle. The FAP-α-targeting peptide was modified on the surface to increase the targeting of tumor tissue. After the photodynamic reaction, the large particles decomposed into small nanoclusters, which enhances drug delivery. The photodynamic response simultaneously induces CAFs apoptosis and breaks the physical barrier that affects deep tumor delivery. Another study revealed that CAFs are closely associated with local angiogenesis while targeting FAP+ CAFs and administration of vascular disrupting agents that kill perivascular cells are associated with a less stable blood-tumor barrier and greater killing of tumor cells. Chen et al. examined how this mechanism used vinblastine combined with a FAP substrate, which significantly reduced the growth of HepG2, A549, HeLa, and CNE-2 xenograft tumors. Both of these treatments rely on drug delivery through dipeptidase activity, which can kill CAFs and weaken the extracellular matrix, subsequently enhancing local drug accumulation. These strategies have good tumor specificity and therapeutic effects in a variety of solid tumor models.
- Conclusion and future direction FAP is a marker that is constitutively expressed on the mesenchymal cells of most epithelial solid tumors. There is increasing understanding that expression of FAP promotes tumor occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis, which worsens the patient’s condition and is associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, our understanding of the physiological effects of FAP expression has expanded to include its effects on the activation of tumorigenic signals, angiogenesis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and even immunosuppressive functions. Thus, there is interest in FAP as a potential target for anti-tumor treatments, and existing research suggests that FAP-targeted drugs can exert curative effects in models of most solid tumors. Although some drugs have been evaluated in clinical studies, drug instability and systemic side effects have limited their application. Moreover, the complex interactions between the tumor microenvironment components have made it difficult to precisely determine the specific contribution(s) of FAP to tumor development. Although its clinical application is limited, nanotechnology is a promising field for addressing these issues by increasing drug delivery, solubility, and adsorption, which may promote greater tumor permeability and retention. Another option is targeted therapy, although there are limited data regarding the anti-cancer efficacy of drugs that solely target CAFs. Further research is needed to determine whether these drugs should be combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or even immunotherapy, as some researchers believe that simply eliminating CAFs might promote metastasis by de-stabilizing the extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor. Therefore, substantial work is needed to continue advancing our understanding of treatments targeting FAP and their anti-tumor effects. Building prodrugs on the basis of nano-platforms has absolute advantages in both fluorescence imaging capabilities and drug loading; coupled with its passive targeting effect (enhanced permeability and retention effect, EPR) and deep delivery to tumor tissues, both of these greatly increase the accumulation of drugs in tumor tissues and reduce the concentration of prodrugs in non-target organs in the body. The structure of nanomaterials is relatively stable, reducing the possibility of accidental release in the circulation. To date, most nanomedicine remains in the research phase. The preparation of most nanodrugs is complicated while the synthesis conditions are strict, therefore, nanomedicine cannot be mass-produced. Furthermore, most nanodrugs used in medicine use materials with good biocompatibility, such as proteins and peptide chains. These materials are extremely easily degraded in the body and, even if they show good results in vitro, reactions may be slowed down in the complex environment of the organism, and some side effects may occur. Therefore, although nanomaterials have many advantages, there remain many unknown parameters that require further study, but we believe that nanomedicine will significantly improve disease treatment.
- EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor): EGFR is thought to be a key oncogenic driver in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with amplification observed in 35-45% of cases.

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a serine protease that is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are found in most epithelial tumors. FAP is also overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, as demonstrated by Röhrich et al. in their study.
- The study by Röhrich et al. investigated FAP and FAPI-PET/CT in gliomas in vitro, in vivo, and in a clinical study including 18 glioma patients (five IDH-mutant gliomas and 13 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas). The study determined elevated levels of tracer uptake in high-grade gliomas but not in low-grade IDH-mutant gliomas, potentially enabling a non-invasive diagnostic distinction.
- Windisch et al. evaluated the above-mentioned IDH-wildtype glioblastomas regarding their usefulness for radiotherapy or biopsy planning. Compared with MRI, FAPI-PET/CT scans lead to increased gross tumor volumes (GTVs), thus changing radiation treatment fields.
- The expression of FAP in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas is associated with tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, the exact role of FAP in tumorigenesis is unknown.
- FAP influences angiogenesis, presumably based on its enzymatic activity, and is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is eventually required for the development of metastasis by enabling migration and invasion.
- FAP is only overexpressed by activated fibroblasts, suggesting that CAFs play a major role in cancer growth.
- The overexpression of FAP in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas is associated with a poor prognosis.
- EGFR: EGFR overexpression and/or mutations play a central role in cell division, migration, adhesion, differentiation, and apoptosis. Genetic alterations in EGFR—including mutations, rearrangements, alternative splicing, and focal amplifications—are the dominant receptor tyrosine kinase lesions in GBM. EGFR deletions and point mutations that keep EGFR in an active conformation are found in 57% of GBMs. EGFR(△2–7) is characterized by a 267 amino acid deletion in the extracellular domain, which results in a receptor that cannot bind ligand and is constitutively active. EGFR(△2–7) is thought to represent a late event, occurring after EGFR-wildtype amplification. EGFR amplification and EGFR(△2–7) mutations might represent concerted evolutionary events that drive the aggressive nature of GBM by promoting invasion and angiogenesis via distinct signaling pathways.
- EGFR amplifications have been reported to indicate a much more aggressive tumor subpopulation. Aibaidula et al. reported patients with EGFR-amplified LGGs had significantly shorter OS than those with EGFR non-amplified tumors (median OS 1.03 y vs. 2.67 y, p = 0.003). Labussière et al. suggested that the influence of EGFR status on prognosis could be more complicated; patients with EGFR amplifications had a better prognosis in the TERT-mutated context than patients with TERT-wildtype tumors. On the other hand, EGFR-wildtype GBM patients had longer survival with TERT-wildtype than patients with EGFR-wildtype and TERT-mutated. Zou et al. showed that EGFR amplification and IDH mutations are mutually exclusive. Therefore, further research is required to determine their multi-genic interaction.
- In LGG, EGFR mutations indicate increased lesion infiltration of specific immune cell types and a poor prognosis. EGFR(△2–7) confers a growth advantage to GBM, and patients with EGFR(△2–7) mutations have significantly shorter survival. EGFR(△2–7) overexpression in the presence of EGFR amplification is the strongest indicator of a poor prognosis.
- On top of that, in WHO CNS5 EGFR gene amplification is one of the criteria to upgrade IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic tumor in adults to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype.
- In summary, currently EGFR-targeting drugs do not prolong OS and PFS, but intensive research for new types of drugs is ongoing.

I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on temporal muscle thickness (TMT) as a potential prognostic marker in glioblastoma, but it does not discuss antigens or their expression levels in different cancer types. Additionally, there is no mention of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of these antigens.
- **EGFR**: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in many cancers, including glioblastoma. It is a common target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies. In the paper, EGFR is mentioned as a potential target for molecular-targeted therapy, and its expression is associated with adult glioblastomas. However, the paper does not provide specific information about its expression levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- **VEGF**: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a protein that promotes angiogenesis and is often overexpressed in cancer cells. The paper mentions that VEGF is commonly expressed in adult glioblastomas and is responsible for increased vascularity, tumor progression, and infiltration. Anti-VEGF therapy, such as bevacizumab, is frequently used in adult glioblastomas but is less effective in children due to the relatively infrequent expression of VEGF in pediatric glioblastomas.
- **PD-L1**: Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a protein that plays a role in immune checkpoint inhibition. The paper mentions that 75-100% of gliomas in a sample of patients exhibited PD-L1 expression, which correlated with the severity of the disease.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR
- MDM4
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as targets for treatment. For example, the paper states that "EGFR-mutated IDHwt gliomas were suggestively enriched in the later-onset cohort," and that "CDKN2A methylation was also significantly associated with later-onset LIHC (FDR = 1.40E-5) and SKCM (FDR = 0.017), and suggestively associated with later-onset THCA (FDR = 0.057) and BRCA (FDR = 0.069)."

The paper also provides information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. For example, it states that "EGFR-mutated IDHwt (FDR = 7.03E-10) and IDH1-mutated IDHmut-codel gliomas (FDR = 0.020) were both significantly enriched in later-onset cases," and that "CDK2NA methylation was also significantly associated with later-onset LIHC (FDR = 1.40E-5) and SKCM (FDR = 0.017), and suggestively associated with later-onset THCA (FDR = 0.057) and BRCA (FDR = 0.069)."

Overall, the paper highlights the potential of these antigens as targets for immunotherapy and tumor targeting in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, and provides valuable insights into their expression levels across different cancer types.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR (including EGFRvIII mutation)
- PTEN
- TP53

These antigens are mentioned in the context of radiogenomics, which is the study of the relationship between imaging features and genomic characteristics of tumors.

However, there is no specific information provided about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- **HLA-I**: The study found no significant difference in the expression levels of HLA-A, B, or C between HMP and NHMP samples in either IDH-mutant or IDH-wildtype tumors. This suggests that HLA expression is unlikely to be the cause of the different correlation of TMB and immune scores in IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype gliomas.

- **Antigen Processing and Presentation (APP)**: The APP score was significantly higher in NHMP samples compared to HMP samples in IDH-wildtype tumors, but higher in HMP samples versus NHMP in IDH-mutant gliomas. The APP score also had a statistically significant correlation with immune score in gliomas. These data indicate that APP function is different between HMP and NHMP samples with different IDH mutation status but correlates with immune score in the sample cohort.

- **Immunosuppressive Genes**: The study analyzed the expression of well-known immunosuppressive genes and found that PD1 and PDL1 showed a statistically significant difference in expression between NHMP and HMP samples in IDH-wildtype gliomas. This suggests a potential therapeutic role of targeting PD1/PDL1 in IDH-wildtype gliomas.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

It is associated with poor prognosis and is a potential target for immunotherapy. The study mentions that EGFRvIII is a GBM-specific antigen and suggests that it could be used as a biomarker for prognosis.

- **MGMT:** MGMT is a DNA repair enzyme that is often methylated in glioblastoma, leading to impaired DNA repair and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. The study highlights the importance of MGMT as a prognostic marker, especially in combination with other factors like IDH1 and MGMT promoter methylation status.

- **miR-21 and miR-10b:** These are microRNAs that are upregulated in glioblastoma and have been proposed as potential biomarkers for prognosis. The study suggests that these microRNAs are associated with the stemness of cancer cells and could be used for tumor targeting.

The study does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it emphasizes the importance of these antigens in glioblastoma and their potential as targets for immunotherapy and tumor targeting strategies.

- **VEGF-A**: This antigen is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is a key player in the angiogenesis process. It is also implicated in the mobilization of endothelial precursor cells and is associated with the histological grade of the tumor. VEGF-A is upregulated in the pseudopalized necrotic region of glioblastoma, primarily driven by the HIF family.

- **VEGFR2**: VEGFR2 is the main receptor mediating the physiological and pathological effects of VEGF, favoring the survival and proliferation of GECs. It is also involved in the vascular normalization process, which leads to an increase in tumor perfusion and oxygenation.

- **Angiopoietin 1 and 2**: These proteins bind to the Tie2 receptor with opposite effects. Angiopoietin 1 activates it, while angiopoietin 2 inhibits it. The activation results in vascular stabilization and permeability decrease, which are vital processes for vessel development in the sane patient. Angiopoietin 2 is particularly overexpressed in glioblastoma and favors the formation of immature vessels at the beginning of angiogenesis. It also has a pro-inflammatory activity that leads to the recruitment of myeloid cells, which are involved in neovascularization and the formation of perivascular and hypoxic niches.

- **DLL4**: This molecule is present in glioblastoma but not in glioma cells, demonstrating the importance of the neo-angiogenic activity in these grade IV tumors. DLL4 is involved in the differentiation of the precursor of the ECs, which can become either a tip cell or a stalk cell. It causes the overexpression of the adjacent Notch receptors, leading to the differentiation into stalk cells due to the interaction with VEGF-A.

- **Notch 1 and 4**: These receptors are recognized on the EC membrane and are vital in determining differentiative pathways of the precursor of the ECs. Notch, together with VEGF, is essential in determining differentiative pathways of the precursor of the ECs, which can become either a tip cell or a stalk cell.

- **YAP-Hippo axis**: This pathway is involved in the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), a vital process for neoplastic cells to develop an invasive phenotype. Metformin suppresses this axis, leading to a decrease in EMT markers in GSCs and the suppression of both mRNA and protein levels of Vimentin in favor of E-Cadherin. The molecular effect is on the YAP-Hippo axis, which induces EMT. By phosphorylating YAP, metformin prevents it from moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and avoids its activity as a transcription modulator in gliomas, thus lowering the activity of all the downstream molecules and decreasing its pro-EMT activity.

- **CLIC1**: This protein shows a functional expression, meaning that it is expressed only when it must act to allow the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. The transient activation of the channel allows metformin to bind the Arg29 domain (on the outer layer of the membrane), stabilizing the close state or obstructing the channel. Analysis on mRNA revealed a correlation between glioblastoma malignancy and expression of CLIC1. In detail, this correlation is present in both human glioblastoma and experimental models. However, because the downstream pathway of the channel is not known yet, it is not clear what is the purpose of these metformin effects, and more studies should be conducted to deepen the investigation.

- **CD133**: This marker is used in in vitro models to recognize GSCs, but it is well known that, because of the plasticity of these cells, these markers are not always expressed. Metformin treatment demonstrated a reduction of cell growth only in CD133+ compared to CD133- and a lack of proliferation in human stem cell.

- **IGF-receptor**: The food uptake determines the increased liver cell expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), IGF-receptor, and insulin-receptor. This, in turn, leads to the activation of a signal transduction starting from the insulin receptor substrate (IRS), involving the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt (PKB, protein kinase B) and inactivating the TSC Complex Subunit 2 (TSC2), known as a tumor suppressor. The activation of mTOR as an indirect result of the signal transduction inhibits TSC2 and promotes cell growth and proliferation. Several studies reported that cancer risk and progression are associated with mTOR activation. Therefore, it is plausible that metformin's anti-cancer effects are associated with the inhibition of mTOR activity.

However, it is worth noting that the paper discusses the role of the SVZ in GBM and the potential for developing novel and effective therapeutic interventions using a combination of models.
- CD161-encoding gene KLRB1: This antigen is expressed by a population of cytotoxic TILs in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Inactivation of KLRB1 or antibody-mediated CD161 blockade resulted in increased T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro and an enhanced response in vivo.
- HER2, IL-13Rα2, and EphA2: These antigens are being targeted by bi- or tri-CAR T-cell approaches in murine models of GBM.
- Survivin: A vaccine approach targeting the oncoprotein survivin has had moderate success in recurrent GBM and warrants further exploration of other vaccine targets. Survivin is an antiapoptotic protein expressed by many tumor types, including GBM. Its expression in GBM has been associated with increased recurrence, chemotherapy resistance, and poor overall prognosis. The SurVaxM vaccine contains a synthetic long peptide mimic that spans the human survivin protein sequence; it expresses MHC Class I epitopes and stimulates the MHC Class II-restricted T-cell responses required for cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell activity against tumors. A Phase I trial of SurVaxM against recurrent GBM demonstrated no serious adverse events and prolonged overall survival following vaccination (86.6 weeks) compared with historical overall survival (30 weeks). A subsequent study identified that glioma patients routinely expressed elevated serum levels of CD9+/GFAP+/SVN+ exosomes, associated with tumor progression, compared with healthy controls. Patients treated with antisurvivin therapy showed decreased levels of these exosomes. Monitoring of CD9+/GFAP+/SVN+ exosomes may be a promising adjunct to the use of MRI in disease surveillance. Current trials are underway to evaluate SurVaxM’s efficacy in newly diagnosed GBM.
- EGFRvIII: This antigen is targeted by CAR T-cell therapy in EGFRvIII-positive recurrent glioblastoma. Although EGFRvIII-targeted CAR T-cells found their way from peripheral blood to the tumor, no meaningful response was detected. This lack of response to anti-EGFRvIII CAR T-cells may be attributable to the significant intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of EGFRvIII expression in glioblastoma as well as to adaptive changes in the local TME, which include changes in antigen expression over time. For instance, following treatment, EGFRvIII was lost in a group of patients.
- IDH1: A vaccine targeting mutant IDH1 in newly diagnosed glioma has shown promising results, with vaccine-induced immune responses observed in 93.3% of patients and no regime-limiting toxicity observed. The 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 63% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year progression-free rate among patients with an immune response was 82%, while the two patients without an immune response had tumor progression within 2 years of diagnosis.
- Cancer germline antigens: These are non-mutated targets with low expression levels in glioblastoma.
- Neoantigens: Only a few mutation-derived neoantigens have been predicted in glioma.
- Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): This antigen is mentioned in the context of immunohistochemical analysis, where it is positive in the patient's case, indicating a glial neoplasm.

- IDH1 R132H: The article discusses the negative immunohistochemical analysis for IDH1 R132H, which is consistent with a wild-type ("de novo") glioblastoma. The absence of IDH1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis and a mean survival of 10-15 months.
I have extracted the following information from the paper:

- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:** The paper does not explicitly mention any antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does discuss the use of radiomics and habitat imaging to identify distinct tumor areas or cell subpopulations, which can be important for determining prognosis and treatment response.

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:** The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of specific antigens across different cancer types.

- **Mentions of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:** The paper does not mention any specific antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, it does discuss the potential of radiomics and habitat imaging to identify aggressive subregions that are important for determining prognosis and treatment response.

As the paper does not contain the information you requested, I have not output anything.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- LAT1: LAT1 is a sodium-independent L-type amino acid transporter that is highly expressed on tumor cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is involved in the uptake of amino acid tracers, such as MET and FET, which are used for the diagnosis of glioma recurrence. LAT1 expression is related to the density of LAT on the cell membrane surface, and its activity is highly specific for tumor cells, making it a promising target for tumor imaging and therapy.

- LAT2: LAT2 is another amino acid transporter that is involved in the uptake of amino acid tracers, such as FDOPA. However, LAT2 is more tumor-selective than LAT1, and its expression is not directly proportional to tumor differentiation status. FDOPA uptake occurs through both LAT1 and LAT2, but LAT2 is more selectively transported through LAT2.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR: EGFR amplification is more prevalent in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, particularly in the NT-2 cluster, compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. EGFR is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies in various cancers, including glioblastoma.
- CDKN2A/B: These genes are frequently deleted in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, especially in the NT-2 cluster. CDKN2A/B deletions have been implicated in tumorigenesis and are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
- TERT promoter mutation: The TERT promoter mutation is more common in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, particularly in the NT-2 cluster, compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. TERT promoter mutations have been associated with tumor progression and are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and their expression levels are compared across different glioma subtypes. While the paper does not provide detailed information on their expression across different cancer types, it highlights their relevance in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting for glioblastoma.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.

The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
- CDKN2A/B
- SOX-2
- Nestin

The MGMT promoter methylation is a molecular marker used in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, specifically for prognostication and clinical decision-making. The MGMT promoter methylation is present in approximately 80% of WHO grade 2 and 35–45% of WHO grade 3 and 4 gliomas. The MGMT gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed repair enzyme that removes alkyl groups from guanine in the DNA. If the MGMT enzyme is active, it can remove the O-6′ methyl groups introduced by TMZ-chemotherapy, partly repairing the DNA and reducing its therapeutic impact. The downregulation of its expression by the methylation of its promoter is thought to increase TMZ efficiency.

The IDH mutation is a molecular profile that distinguishes IDH-mutant astrocytomas from IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Tumors with a mutation of IDH have a molecular profile and thus an origin distinct from IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. This is supported by evidence that tumors previously diagnosed as IDH-wildtype astrocytomas corresponding to WHO (2016) grades II or III actually represent IDHwt glioblastoma and are now classified as such, while former IDH-mutant glioblastomas have been renamed into IDH-mutant astrocytomas (CNS WHO grade 4) to reflect a distinct lineage. These tumors are defined by having morphological high-grade features (necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation) and/or the presence of CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion.

The SOX-2 and Nestin antigens are mentioned in the context of immunofluorescence staining to identify stem-like glioma-initiating cells. These cells are believed to play a major role in tumor initiation and recurrence and are thought to be particularly resilient. The strong co-expression of SOX-2 and Nestin in all specimens before and after treatment, regardless of treatment group and cell line, indicates that the stem-like cell characteristics of all three cell lines were not altered by the treatment.

The CDKN2A/B antigen is mentioned in the context of the 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumors, which defines IDH-mutant astrocytomas (CNS WHO grade 4) as having morphological high-grade features (necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation) and/or the presence of CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific roles in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - TNC (Tenascin-C)
   - C1RL (Complement C1q Receptor-Like)
   - FABP5 (Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5)
   - CSTA (Cystatin A)
   - BCL3 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3)

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - TNC: Highly expressed in glioblastoma, especially in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
   - C1RL: Upregulated in glioblastoma, particularly in mesenchymal and primary glioblastoma.
   - FABP5: Correlated with an undifferentiated tumor phenotype in glioblastoma.
   - CSTA: Upregulated in human malignant gliomas, especially in invasive GBMs.
   - BCL3: Overexpressed in various cancers, including breast cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, endometrial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer.

- **Mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - TNC: Printed peptide arrays identified prognostic TNC serum antibodies in glioblastoma patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker.
   - C1RL: C1RL-associated genes are enriched in immune response processes, and C1RL expression is correlated with reduced tumor purity and increased M2 macrophage infiltration in glioblastoma.
   - FABP5: A known tumor-associated antigen that can respond to B cells.
   - CSTA: CSTA-positive cells are located close to tumor blood vessels and inflammatory host cells in GBM tumor samples, indicating its potential role in the tumor microenvironment.
   - BCL3: BCL3 expression promotes resistance to alkylating chemotherapy in gliomas. In ovarian cancer, BCL3 induces immune checkpoint PD-L1 expression, mediating cancer cell proliferation.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- TERT promoter
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B
- MTAP
- TP53
- EGFR
- PTEN
- NF1
- BRAF
- PDGFRA
- CDK4
- PIK3CA

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as therapeutic targets for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The study also highlights the clinical actionability of these antigens, meaning the probability of being able to receive appropriate molecular targeting therapeutic agents.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it does mention that the frequency of genomic aberrations for FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 is lower than other MAPK-activating genes such as EGFR and PTEN, but the total proportion of mutations in the FGFR family is not negligible. This suggests that pan-FGFR inhibitors might be an effective treatment for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

Additionally, the paper discusses the potential of using the comprehensive genomic profiling test (CGPT) to detect driver genomic aberrations, enabling glioma patients to participate in clinical trials and the categorization of these patients based on the WHO 2021 classification. The authors emphasize the importance of considering CGPT in the early clinical courses of patients with glioblastoma, given the limited standard treatment options and high recurrence rate.

I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
The paper does not provide specific information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the EGFRvIII antigen in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. The EGFRvIII antigen is a mutated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is commonly found in glioblastoma and other cancers. The paper discusses a clinical trial (NCT02122822) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of a peptide vaccine called rindopepimut, which targets the EGFRvIII antigen. The trial showed a possible long-term survival benefit for GBM patients with significant residual disease who received rindopepimut compared to those with minimal residual disease. The authors suggest that residual disease is associated with greater antigen expression, leading to enhanced anti-tumor immunity required for a therapeutic effect.

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which involves engineering T cells to target specific antigens on cancer cells. While the paper does not provide details about the specific antigens targeted in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, it highlights the importance of residual tumor burdens in generating an effective immune response in immunotherapies such as CAR-T therapies.

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- IDH-wildtype glioblastomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.
- FAP is highly expressed in the stroma surrounding more than 90% of epithelial-derived tumors and their metastases and is consistently expressed in bone and soft tissue tumor cells.
- FAP is one of the specific markers of CAFs in TME and is closely related to tumor invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and prognosis and is considered an essential target for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.
- FAP is highly expressed on the cell surface of high-grade gliomas (excluding diffuse astrocytomas).
- Clinical studies have shown high uptake of FAPI imaging agents in high-grade gliomas (SUVmax = 2.8 ± 0.6), whereas low-grade gliomas showed only mild uptake (SUVmax = 0.35 ± 0.10).
- FAP imaging agents may be helpful in the detection and target area sketching of high-grade gliomas in the brain, non-invasive grading of gliomas, and assessment of prognosis after radiotherapy.

The paper does not provide any information on antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): This antigen is highly expressed on the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of the tumor stroma in various tumor entities, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. FAP contributes to tumor progression and a worse prognosis. It is a promising biomarker and target for medical interventions, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs): CAFs are a heterogeneous cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and their presence is associated with resistance to immunotherapy in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CAFs can have different origins, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, resident tissue fibroblasts, and adipocytes.
- Integrin b1/CD29, α-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), PDGFR-β (platelet-derived growth factor receptor β), CAV1 (caveolin 1), and S100-A4/FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1): These markers are used to classify CAF subpopulations (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1 (CAF-S1 FAP+), which is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2): HER2 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. HER2 expression is associated with a poor prognosis and is a target for immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor): EGFR is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. EGFR is a target for immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- CXCL12β (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12β) and CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4): These molecules are involved in the initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and distant metastatic processes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CXCL12β is secreted by CAF-S1, and CXCR4 is expressed in cancer cells.
- PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) and PD-L2 (programmed cell death ligand 2): These ligands are expressed by CAFs from various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. They are targets for immunotherapy, including anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-L2 immunotherapies.
- GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1): GLUT1 expression is commonly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with an inability to express an EMT phenotype.

The paper also mentions the following in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting:

- CAF-S1 FAP+ promotes an immunosuppressive environment by secreting CXCL12β, increasing T cell survival, and promoting the differentiation of CD25+FOXP3+ cells.
- CAF-S1 FAP+ is associated with resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and reduces antitumor immunity.
- CAFs from IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and other cancer types have shown expression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2, particularly the CAF-S1 FAP+ subset.
- The CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation is an important source of CXCL12 secretion, which plays a crucial role in resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer.
- Targeted CAF therapy can potentially inhibit metastasis and cancer progression by reducing immunosuppression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment.
- The dynamic behavior of FAP is associated with its functions in the progression phase during cancer evolution, including tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, promotion of tumor proliferation, and immunomodulation.
- Additional clinical studies are needed to define the clinical impact of the non-invasive in vivo detection of FAP in newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients and its implication in determining candidates for immunotherapy and target therapy combined with conventional therapies.
- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9)
   - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α)
   - Nestin
   - Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1)

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - CA9: Widely expressed in perinecrotic tumor cells, particularly in recurrent glioblastomas.
   - HIF-1α: Expressed in tumor cells around sites of necrosis and also found in tumor cells not directly adjacent to necrotic areas.
   - Nestin: Expressed in many glioblastomas, with downregulation associated with differentiation.
   - FOXM1: Overexpressed in glioblastomas and upregulated in recurrent glioblastomas at both mRNA and protein levels.

- **Immunotherapy and tumor targeting:**
   - The study investigates the potential of FOXM1 as a biomarker for survival during anti-VEGF therapy, suggesting that it may be a marker for proliferating glioma stem cells (GSCs) and a prediction biomarker for survival.
   - The authors also discuss the role of vascular co-option as a mechanism of resistance to antiangiogenic treatment, which may be exploited by recurrent glioblastomas to escape anti-VEGF therapy.
   - The study highlights the importance of understanding the TME and its impact on tumor dormancy, as well as the potential of combining Bevacizumab with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- gp96 (glucose-regulated protein 96): Overexpressed in grade IV gliomas, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Its expression is associated with increased malignancy and worse clinical outcomes. gp96-selective inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies are under development as potential treatments.
- HSP90 (heat shock protein 90): gp96 belongs to the HSP90 family, and its expression is associated with various malignancies, including gliomas.
- GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein): Used as a marker for glioma cells in the study.
- CD4, CD8, and PD-1: These immune cell markers are used to assess T cell infiltration in gliomas. Their densities are associated with clinical outcomes and can be influenced by gp96 expression.
- IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase): A mutation status used to classify gliomas, with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas showing higher gp96 expression and worse outcomes.

The paper also discusses the potential of using gp96-peptide complexes as a vaccine (HSPPC-96 vaccine) to treat various cancers, including glioblastoma. The vaccine has shown promising results in early clinical studies, and the authors suggest that understanding the impact of gp96 expression and its association with immune cell infiltration could provide insights into vaccine immunity and help identify responsive patients.
- **FGFR3-TACC3 fusion**: This fusion is found in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with characteristic histopathological and molecular features. It is a potential target for targeted therapy, with anlotinib showing promising results in a case report.
- **PDK1**: PDK1 is a hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1 regulated gene that may promote EGFR activation, sustaining malignant progression. Inhibiting PDK1 can greatly inhibit glioma cell colony and sphere formation and sensitize glioma spheres to temozolomide toxicity.
- **CD2**: CD2 is a transmembrane molecule expressed on T, natural killer (NK), and dendritic cells, essential for immunology. It is involved in tumor invasion and is highly expressed in breast cancer.
- **COL5A1**: COL5A1 is related to the occurrence and progression of multiple types of malignant tumors, including breast cancer and gliomas. It is positively correlated with the increasing malignancy of glioblastoma through the PPRC1-ESM1 axis activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and it may be a potential therapeutic target for glioma.
- **PBK**: PBK expression is associated with cell growth and apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and immune responses, playing an essential role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. It is found to be upregulated in GBM patients, and its inhibition can almost completely abolish tumor growth, making it a potentially promising therapeutic target for GBM treatment.
- **FANCA**: FANCA is associated with tissue proliferation and is found to be overexpressed in many types of cancers. Targeting the FA pathway may provide a novel strategy for the sensitization of solid tumors and investigation of chemoresistance in different tumor types.
- **ANXA7**: ANXA7 is a ubiquitinated tumor suppressor gene. Loss of ANXA7 function stabilizes the EGFR protein, augments EGFR transforming signaling in glioblastoma cells, and promotes tumorigenesis.
- **TACC3**: TACC3 is often mentioned with FGFR3-TACC3 fusion, an oncogenic driver. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions generate powerful oncogenes that combine growth-promoting effects with aneuploidy through the activation of as yet unclear intracellular signaling mechanisms. FGFR inhibition has shown encouraging outcomes in mouse studies, and targeting FGFR3-TACC3 fusion is evaluated by many ongoing early-phase human clinical trials.

I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- **Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)**: EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently amplified and overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies. EGFR amplification is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in glioblastoma.

- **Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT)**: TERT is a catalytic subunit of telomerase, which is an enzyme that maintains telomere length and promotes cellular immortality. TERT promoter mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased telomerase activity and poor prognosis. TERT is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting approaches.

- **Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B)**: CDKN2A/B are tumor suppressor genes that encode the proteins p16INK4A and p14ARF, respectively. These proteins regulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B is associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT is a DNA repair enzyme that removes alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine, thereby reversing the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents like temozolomide. MGMT promoter methylation status is a critical factor in predicting response to temozolomide in glioblastoma. MGMT expression is associated with resistance to temozolomide and poor prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

- **Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH)**: IDH is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. IDH mutations are common in gliomas, and IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. IDH mutations are also associated with increased sensitivity to metformin, as mentioned in the paper.

- **p53**: p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair. p53 mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **ATRX**: ATRX is a chromatin remodeler that is involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. ATRX mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and poor prognosis.

- **PTEN**: PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. PTEN mutations or deletions are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **p16 and p14**: p16 and p14 are tumor suppressor proteins encoded by the CDKN2A/B gene. p16 (INK4A) inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, while p14 (ARF) stabilizes p53. Homozygous deletion of p16 and p14 is associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

These antigens are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and poor prognosis. They are potential targets for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies, as they can be used to develop specific antibodies or other targeted therapies to selectively kill cancer cells expressing these antigens.
- PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha): PDGFRA is the second most frequently mutated tyrosine kinase receptor in glioblastoma (GBM), and its amplification is associated with oligodendroglial morphology and malignancy. The study found that PDGFRA gain/amplification is a significant predictor of poor prognosis in patients with IDH wild-type GBM.
- MGMTp (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter): MGMTp methylation is a well-established favorable prognostic marker for survival and predicts the response to temozolomide in patients with GBM. The study showed that unmethylated MGMTp is a significant predictor of poor prognosis in IDH wild-type GBM.

The paper does not provide information about antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It also does not mention any antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein
- FGFR3
- TACC3
- OLIG2
- GFAP
- OLIG2
- GFAP
- CDK4
- MDM2

These antigens are specifically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are not mentioned in the context of other cancer types in this paper. The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is a recurrent oncogenic fusion protein found in about 3% of squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial carcinoma, 3.9% of cervical cancer patients, and 4% of glioblastoma patients. The FGFR3 gene and the TACC3 gene are located on chromosome 4p16.3, only 48kb apart from each other within a region that is associated with translocation-causing breakpoints in multiple myeloma. This spatial proximity and the localization at a double-strand hotspot is one theory explaining why this fusion protein is found so frequently. An alternative explanation of the frequent recurrence of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion is that the fusion protein leads to specific survival benefits, such as proliferation gain and increased cell survival. Cells that express the fusion protein might thereby prevail in a setting of selection pressure.

The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is involved in several cellular processes and signaling cascades, leading to FGFR3-TACC3 overexpression, increased kinase activity, and corresponding downstream signaling, morphological changes, increased cell growth, altered cellular metabolism, stress response, and even dysregulated mitotic progression, resulting in aneuploidy. The kinase activity of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein plays a crucial role in the proliferation and survival of glioblastoma cells. The ability to dimerize TACC3 leads to the presence of a constitutively dimerized, and thereby activated, FGFR3 tyrosine kinase domain in fusion-positive tumor cells and hyperactivated downstream signaling, resulting in an overexpression of phosphorylated FRS2, the initial intracellular binding partner of FGFR3, to activate ERK1/2 and AKT signaling. Parker et al. detected an increased activation of pERK, but not of STAT3 and pAKT, in fusion-positive cells while other authors saw enhanced STAT3 and STAT1 activation. Nelson et al. showed that only plasma membrane localized FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein leads to formation of oncogenic foci in fusion transfected NIH3T3 cells. This goes along with increased MAPK signaling activation, while cytoplasmatic localized FGFR3-TACC3 does not induce oncogenic transformation, supporting the hypothesis that the oncogenic force of the fusion protein is dependent on its kinase activity. The phosphorylation site Y746 is of major importance for activation of ERK, STAT and PI3K signaling. Y746 is hyperphosphorylated in FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive cells and MAPK activation is increased in fusion-positive cells. Treatment with the kinase inhibitors BGJ398 and trametinib resulted in reduction in MAPK signaling and had an antitumor effect in FGFR3-TACCex11 and FGFR3-TACC3ex8 transfected cells, but the signaling and treatment response differed between the two isoforms.

TACC3 in its wildtype form is phosphorylated by Aurora-A and forms a complex with clathrin and ch-TOG, which is localized to the mitotic spindle apparatus and provides its stability. When fused to the FGFR3-protein, TACC3 lacks a phosphorylation site for Aurora-A. Confocal imaging of FGFR3-TACC3 showed an arc-shaped structure of the protein, bending over and enchasing the metaphase spindle poles, but not relocating to the mid body, leading to erratic mitotic segregation. FGFR3-TACC3-positive cells exhibit a 3 to 5-fold higher number of errors in chromosomal segregation and resulting aneuploidy, an effect, that could be reduced to 80% by treatment with the kinase inhibitor PD173074. This, however, implies that the activity of FGFR3-TACC3 in aneuploidy induction is dependent on its kinase activity.

Gene ontology mapping of the dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed enriched expression of genes that are related to oxidative phosphorylation, high mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Additionally, increased mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial mass, and higher levels of ATP were detected in FGFR3-TACC3 transfected astrocytes compared to control cells, and the fusion-positive cells showed an elevated basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate, as well as a mild increase in the extracellular acidification rate. Gene expression levels of the respiratory complex proteins SDHB, UQCRC1, ATP5A1, and the mitochondrial membrane transporter VDAC1 were elevated in fusion-positive cells. Anti-pY immunoprecipitation showed that only FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive cells contained phosphorylated PIN4, an activator of mitochondrial metabolism and anabolic response, leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species and thereby, elevated expression of the transcription regulators PGC1α and ERRγ, which increase mitochondrial metabolism. Accordingly, the FGFR3-TACC3-positive cells were sensitive towards treatment with mitochondrial inhibitors such as menadione, metformin, and tigecycline in vitro.

Besides this, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion leads to morphological changes characterized by the rounding up of the cells in HEK293T cells, the activation of cell signaling pathways related to chaperone activation, the stress response and regulation of tp53 expression, and the degradation and resistance to EGFR inhibitors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma cells.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies regarding treatment with FGFR-inhibitors for FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive gliomas have led to promising results. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZD4547, PD173074, BGJ398, and JNJ-42756493 inhibited the proliferation of FGFR3-TACC3 transfected astrocytes in vitro and led to reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in glioma-bearing mice. PD173074 was even more able to suppress the kinase phosphorylation of FGFR3 and reduced aneuploidy by about 80%. In FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioma cell lines, the FGFR-inhibitors PD173074 and AZD4547 had an antiproliferative effect, and the kinase inhibitor pazopanib caused cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, a higher sensitivity of fusion-positive glioma cells towards the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 was observed.

In other cancer cell lines, such as cholangiocarcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma, a higher potency of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has also been described. Parker-Kerrigan et al. transfected 10 unique siRNAs into glioblastoma and bladder cancer cell lines, which led to the depletion of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein, while wildtype FGFR3 was not affected. The siRNA knockdown of FGFR3-TACC3 in glioblastoma cells leads to reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

A small number of case reports regarding the use of kinase inhibitors in patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioblastomas exists: Wang et al. treated two patients with the kinase inhibitor anlotinib. A 65-year-old woman with a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioblastoma, diagnosed in 01/2020, received anlotinib after she had tumor progress following gross total resection and treatment with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide and five adjuvant cycles of temozolomide. She had partial response after three months of treatment with anlotinib and was still alive at the time of publication. The second patient, a 44-year-old woman, was diagnosed with FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma in 12/2017. She was treated with radiochemotherapy, according to the STUPP-regimen, and afterwards received treatment with nedaplatin and bevacizumab. In 06/2018, she had tumor progress and started treatment with a temozolomide rescue scheme and anlotinib. After two months, she had partial response and was also still alive when the authors published the article.

The kinase inhibitor JNJ-42756493 was also administered to two glioblastoma patients, a 52-year-old man and a 64-year-old woman, who were both diagnosed with FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma. Both patients underwent gross total resection of the tumor, followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. After they experienced tumor progress, both received JNJ-42756493. The first patient reached stable disease for 115 days before he exhibited new tumor progression, while the second patient had partial response after 4 weeks and was on treatment for 134 days before she exhibited progressive disease. The pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib (JNJ-42756493) was administered to 65 patients with solid tumors in a phase 1 trial. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were detected in one glioblastoma patient, two urothelial carcinoma patients, and one patient with adrenal carcinoma who showed partial response under treatment with erdafitinib.

Currently, there are diverse ongoing trials regarding the use of tyrosine kinase receptors in FGFR3-TACC3 positive glioblastomas. The FGFR1-3 receptor inhibitors AZ4547 and BGJ398 were both evaluated for patients with FGFR1-TACC1 and FGFR3-TACC3 fused glioblastomas; however, the results have not yet been published. A study considering infigratinib (BGJ398) for patients with unselected FGFR-altered glioblastoma proved the safety of the drug, despite only limited effects. Nevertheless, response with a stable disease for over one year was observed in a patient with a FGFR3-TACC3-fused glioblastoma.

The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is a promising target for personalized diagnostics and specific therapy in glioblastoma. Its specific functional and clinical relevance should justify further effort to answer open questions and establish the markers in daily clinical practice.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- IDH1 R132H
- Ki-67
- Nestin

These antigens were used as immunohistochemical markers in the study, and their expression was evaluated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and IDH-mutant astrocytoma samples. The study did not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.

The study did not mention these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, it is worth noting that the authors discussed the potential role of IDH1 mutations in therapeutic management, highlighting ongoing clinical trials with chemotherapeutics and targeted vaccines targeting the IDH1 mutation.
- **Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX)**: ATRX is a protein that plays a role in genomic stability and cell division. ATRX mutations cause genomic instability, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT), as well as increasing susceptibility to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Loss of nuclear ATRX expression due to ATRX gene mutation has been correlated with a survival benefit and is mainly seen in secondary GBM, IDH mutant. ATRX expression was found in 91.2% of patients in this study, with 8.8% showing loss of nuclear ATRX expression.

- **Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)**: EGFR plays a central role in cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, and angiogenesis, as well as influencing DNA repair and contributing to radio- and chemotherapy resistance. Amplification of the EGFR gene occurs in 30-50% of IDH-wildtype GBMs and is correlated with overexpression of EGFR protein. The most common mutated variant in GBM is tumor-specific EGFR splice variant III (EGFRvIII) which results from gene truncation and has been associated with worse survival prognosis and increased carcinogenicity. Current data concerning the survival correlation of EGFR are inconclusive, with some studies showing shorter survival and some studies showing no correlation with survival. A large meta-analysis concluded that most studies did not regard confounders and/or did not differentiate EGFR wildtype from EGFR mutations, so no clear statement could be made regarding EGFR status and survival prognosis. EGFRvIII expression was found in 40.9% of patients in this study, with a borderline significant correlation in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, which did not hold up in univariate and multivariate analysis.

- **Ki-67**: Ki-67 is a protein expressed exclusively in proliferating cells, with the Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) correlating closely with histological tumor grade in gliomas. A Ki-67 LI of 10% is regarded as a reliable criterion for malignancy. Although some studies see Ki-67 LI as a reliable predictor of survival with higher Ki-67 LI indicating worse prognosis, more reliable even than histologic grade or age, other studies could not find this association, possibly due to low reproducibility of Ki-67 LI detection between laboratories and examiners. Therefore, the role of Ki-67 LI as a prognostic factor is still disputed. A median Ki-67 LI of 20% is in line with the malignant nature and high proliferation of GBMs and averages approximately in between previously published data. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with lower Ki-67 LI < 20%, matching previous studies. The present study was able to show a tendency toward better overall survival in patients with a reduction of Ki-67 LI upon progression or recurrence, with statistical significance being reached for a median Ki-67 LI quotient of 2, but with significance being missed for both an absolute median reduction of 6% as well as for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Ki-67 LI quotient ≤ 1 vs. > 1, which could be due to the small sample size. As mentioned above, the role of Ki-67 LI as a prognostic factor is still disputed due to differing results concerning its impact on survival. A previous study has discussed suboptimal methodological approaches as a possible factor in this variance. In the present study, the strength of the study lies firstly in the monocentric approach, seeing as Ki-67 LI detection took place at a single laboratory and with minimal examiner variance, and secondly in the inclusion of treatment criteria via analysis of the partial collective "favorable subgroup," making the significant results regarding Ki-67 LI and progression-free survival more reliable. Furthermore, the approach of integrating Ki-67 LI into the existing RPA score allows for the inclusion of further prognostic factors and could, in the authors' eyes, show that inclusion of Ki-67 LI can contribute to an improved assessment of survival. Concerning a possible impact of Ki-67 LI on treatment stratification, to the authors' knowledge, no data exist regarding glioblastoma, and this was also not the focus of the study. However, Ki-67 has been shown to impact treatment response in neuroendocrine neoplasms, prostate cancer, and metastatic lung carcinoids, as well as impacting treatment options for breast cancer. Such promising results in other malign entities combined with the prognostic value of Ki-67 LI as seen and discussed in the study emphasize the need for prospective trials to investigate a possible role of Ki-67 LI in stratification for treatment of glioblastoma.

- **O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT is involved in the repair of DNA strands by removing genotoxic alkyl groups from guanine. Methylation of the MGMT promoter reduces MGMT expression and thereby increases sensitivity to alkylating chemotherapy. Therefore, MGMT promoter methylation is consistently correlated with better survival when alkylating treatment has been performed. MGMT promoter methylation was more common in the study collective than expected, with 60% of patients having a methylated MGMT promoter compared to 40% in previously published data. A significantly better progression-free and overall survival in all collectives is in line with known data, with overall survival of 13 months for non-methylated and 18 months for methylated MGMT promoter coinciding with previous studies.

The paper does not provide information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, their expression levels across different cancer types, or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
- CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4)
- PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha)
- DDIT3 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3)
- KIT (KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase)

These antigens are mentioned in the context of their expression levels across different cancer types, with the article noting that they are found at varying frequencies in glioblastoma cases. For example, EGFR is amplified in 47.9% of cases, CDK4 in 18.2%, PDGFRA in 14.2%, DDIT3 in 10.8%, and KIT in 10.8%.

The article also discusses the potential implications of these antigens for immunotherapy and tumor targeting. It highlights that the knockout of some of these genes, such as EGFR and CDK4, can significantly impact the proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines. This suggests that targeting these antigens with immunotherapeutic approaches could be a promising strategy for treating IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

However, the article does not provide specific details about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their potential as immunotherapy targets. Further research and validation would be required to fully explore these aspects.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
- Angiogenesis genes
- 2-HG

**VEGF:**
VEGF is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype gliomas, which are described as having higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. This is contrary to previous reports, suggesting that the relationship between VEGF expression and IDH status is complex and may vary depending on other factors.

**Angiogenesis genes:**
Angiogenesis genes are upregulated in contrast enhancement regions of IDH-wildtype gliomas, leading to increased contrast. This finding highlights the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of these tumors and their potential as therapeutic targets.

**2-HG:**
2-HG is a signature metabolite produced by IDH mutations, and its increase is associated with tumor cell proliferation. The article discusses the potential of using 2-HG as a prognostic marker and a target for noninvasive detection of IDH mutation status through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

While these antigens are not explicitly mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, their strong expression in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells suggests that they could be potential targets for immunotherapeutic approaches or tumor-targeting strategies. However, further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of these antigens in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- IDH1: IDH1 is a prognostic marker for glioma, with IDH1 mutations associated with a favourable prognosis and IDH1 wildtype associated with lower overall survival. IDH1 is also used in the diagnosis of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, with IDH1 wildtype characterising glioblastomas.
- IDH2: IDH2 mutations are also favourable prognostic factors and can facilitate the diagnosis of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, while IDH2 wildtype is associated with lower overall survival and characterises glioblastomas.
- MGMT: MGMT promoter methylation is a favourable prognostic factor associated with enhanced sensitivity to alkylating agents in chemotherapy.
- ATRX: ATRX mutations are associated with wildtype 1p/19q and with mutations in IDH1/2 and TP53, and may be involved in alternative lengthening of telomeres, contributing to genomic instability.
- TP53: TP53 is a prognostic factor for glioma, with gain of function mutations in the TP53 gene causing overexpression of p53 protein, which is associated with shorter overall survival.
- P53: P53 expression is significantly positively correlated with age at diagnosis and is a prognostic marker for glioma.
- Palladin: Palladin is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for glioma, with overexpression of wild-type palladin's isoform 4 originating mostly from the malignant cell population and being involved in the progression of aggressive adult glioma tumours. Palladin expression is correlated with decreased survival and is a stronger predictor of overall survival than currently used prognostic markers.

- SRPX2: SRPX2 is a secreted protein that plays a role in the extracellular matrix and has been associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma. It promotes tumour progression and metastasis in primary GICs. SRPX2 expression is highest in regions of microvascular proliferation and hyperplastic blood vessels, while it is lowest in the leading edge and infiltrating tumour. SRPX2 knockdown leads to impaired invasion in two BE-GIC lines in in vitro assays.
- RARRES2: RARRES2 is a chemoattractant that binds to Chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1). It is significantly up-regulated in BE-GICs compared to nBE-GICs, in both the authors' cohort and the HGCC cohort, and in non-G-CIMP tumour tissue relative to non-tumour brain tissue. High expression of RARRES2 is correlated with a worse prognosis. RARRES2 is well known to play a role in inflammation and promoting the migration of plasmacytoid DC, macrophages, and NK-cells. In scRNAseq data from Pombo Antunes et al., 2021, and Neftel et al., 2019, the receptor CMKLR1 is expressed in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) from newly diagnosed GBMs, particularly in non-hypoxic TAMs as compared to hypoxic TAMs in recurrent glioblastomas.

I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1): PD-L1 is a checkpoint protein that is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. It is a potential target for immunotherapy, as higher risk scores were significantly associated with upregulation of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1.
- CD276: CD276 is another immune checkpoint protein that is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is also associated with a poor prognosis, and its expression is significantly correlated with higher risk scores.
- CD44: CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. It is expressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma, and its expression is significantly correlated with higher risk scores in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is associated with a poor prognosis and a higher risk of recurrence compared to IDH-mutant glioblastoma.
- The study suggests that the developed prognostic model, based on risk scores, could be used as a potential biomarker for risk stratification and treatment response prediction in glioblastoma patients.
- The prognostic model was constructed using 10× scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data, and it effectively classified patients into high- and low-risk groups based on their risk scores.
- The study also explored the relationship between risk scores, TMB values, and PD-L1 expression levels, but found no significant correlation between higher risk scores and higher TMB values.

- SELP (P-selectin): Overexpressed and oversecreted by IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, SELP has been linked to increased metastasis and spreading of melanoma and colon cancer cells via PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) mediated platelet activation. Blocking SELP function has been shown to delay tumor growth, prolong survival, and improve immune infiltration in vivo.
- PSGL-1: While PSGL-1 is considered a T cell immune checkpoint, it has also been implicated in aiding the spreading and metastasis of melanoma and colon cancer cells via P-selectin-mediated platelet activation. In glioblastoma, cancer cells overexpress and oversecrete SELP to exploit PSGL-1 signaling in glioma-associated microglia/macrophages.
- PD1: PD1 is expressed on intratumoral myeloid cells in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its expression is correlated with the accumulation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) during cancer-driven emergency myelopoiesis. Myeloid cell-specific PD1 ablation has been shown to increase Tem cells and improve their functionality, mediating anti-tumor immunity despite perceived PD1 expression on T cells.
- CTLA-4: CTLA-4 is expressed on circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells in cancer patients, including glioblastoma, and is associated with advanced disease and a negative prognosis independent of disease stage. The increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules on circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells likely reflects the immunosuppressive network in glioblastoma patients.
- GITR: GITR expression is increased on circulating CD4+ T cells in glioblastoma patients, which is linked to increased frequencies of regulatory T cell subsets and underlines the immune dysregulation in these patients.
- 2-HG (2-hydroxyglutarate): The oncometabolite 2-HG is released in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and contributes to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
- CD163: CD163 is overexpressed in parenchymal microglia/macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its increased expression is paralleled by increased expression of PSGL-1.
- CD206: CD206 is upregulated in the anti-inflammatory/pro-tumorigenic activation of microglia/macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- CD276 (B7-H3): CD276 is a solid tumor-associated antigen that is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages.
- HLA-DR: HLA-DR is downregulated on circulating monocytes in glioblastoma patients, and its expression is influenced by steroid medication.
- CD169: CD169 is expressed on macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- CD273 (PDL2): CD273 is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

These antigens are not only highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma but also play a role in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and the regulation of immune responses. Some of these antigens, such as SELP, PSGL-1, PD1, and CTLA-4, have been targeted in immunotherapy approaches, while others, like 2-HG, CD163, CD206, and CD276, have been implicated in tumor progression and immune evasion.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- **Fibronectin 1 (FN1)**: FN1 is a prognostic risk factor and is significantly upregulated in GBM samples. It may play a role in GBM progression through ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.
- **HLA-DRA, CD44, SLC1A5, EGFR, ITGB2, PTPRJ**: These genes were found to be significantly upregulated in GBM. High expression of CD44, PTPRJ, and HLA-DRA was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival.
- **IL-13Ra2**: IL-13Ra2 is an interleukin receptor that is overexpressed in over 60% of GBM and 44.1% of gliomas. Clinical trials have found immunotherapies targeting the IL-13Ra2 receptor to be effective.
- **CD133/CD44**: CD133 is co-expressed with CD44 and linked to similar molecular features.
- **B7-H3**: B7-H3 is a marker for SVZ-GBM cells and its inhibition in GBM cells reduces their tumorigenicity. Out of the two B7-H3 isoforms, only 2IgB7-H3 was detected in non-cancerous brain tissue, whereas 4IgB7-H3 was specific to GBM. 2IgB7-H3 expression was higher in GBM recurrences and increased resistance to temozolomide-mediated apoptosis.
- IDH1 R132H: This marker is examined for reactivity (positive or negative) and the cytoplasmic intensity of the reaction (strong, moderate, or weak).
- Nestin: This marker is evaluated by the cytoplasmic immunoreaction (strong, moderate, or weak) of glial cells and reactivity (positive or negative) in endothelial cells. It is expressed in neural stem cells, cancer stem cells, and undifferentiated cancer cells. In some tumors, such as cerebral ones, its overexpression correlates with tumor grade and invasiveness and indicates cellular immaturity.
- Ki-67: The reference index for this marker is calculated as the percentage of positive nuclei after counting on 10 HPF of at least 1000 nuclei.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, and their expression levels are assessed using immunohistochemical methods. The study also discusses the importance of these antigens in the prognosis and survival of patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): FAP is a novel target for molecular-based PET imaging, which has shown promising results in various tumors, including glioblastoma. FAP is overexpressed in most glioblastomas, especially in the mesenchymal subtype, and is associated with FAP-positive vessels, foci of neoplastic cells, and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. The study found that 18F-FAPI PET/CT detected 69.6% of all lesions in glioblastoma patients, with a 100% positive predictive value. However, the study did not find any correlation between FAP expression and PET/CT parameters, and some lesions were not labeled with FAP on immunohistochemistry.

- Ki-67: Ki-67 is a marker of cell proliferation and is often used as a prognostic marker in glioblastoma. The study found that the Ki-67 index was not correlated with the FAPI-PET/CT parameters, such as MGMT promoter methylation, TERT, and IDH mutation. However, the study also noted that only one of the glioblastoma patients had IDH mutation, which may have limited the ability to detect correlations.

- IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.
- CD14 and CD64: These antigens are expressed at higher levels on microglia in IDH-wildtype GBM compared to IDH-mutant tumors.
- HLA-DR and MHC I/II: These antigens are expressed at higher levels on macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM compared to IDH-mutant tumors.
- CD163 and CX3CR1: These antigens are expressed on a subset of macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM, and their expression is associated with immunosuppressive functions.
- CADM1: This antigen is expressed on macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM, and its expression is associated with immunosuppressive functions.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting in GBM. For example, the article discusses the potential of targeting CD163+ macrophages with anti-CD163 antibodies as a therapeutic strategy. Additionally, the article mentions that CD163 and CX3CR1 are potential targets for immunotherapy in GBM, as they are associated with immunosuppressive functions.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- IDH1 wildtype
- pMGMT
- IDH2

These antigens are not mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text. However, the paper does discuss the potential significance of these molecular markers in determining the prognosis of glioblastoma patients.

The paper highlights that the presence of IDH1 wildtype and pMGMT methylation status did not show a significant difference between cystic and non-cystic glioblastomas. This suggests that the improved survival observed in cystic glioblastomas is not solely due to these molecular markers.

Additionally, the paper mentions that none of the studies included in the review compared the presence of 1p/19q co-deletion or IDH2 mutation status. Zhou et al. suggested that the association of cystic glioblastoma with telomere length and pMGMT methylation should be further analyzed.

It is important to note that the overall quality of the evidence in this study was low, and the authors recommend future prospective studies with better control for bias to investigate the survival outcomes of cystic versus non-cystic glioblastoma.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- S100A8
- S100A9
- MMP9
- CXCR1

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as novel biomarkers for glioblastoma. The paper also highlights the role of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment and their association with angiogenesis, immune response, and tumor progression.

Here is the relevant information extracted from the paper:

- S100A8 and S100A9: These proteins are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells and are associated with poor prognosis. They are involved in maintaining tumor angiogenesis and promoting malignant progression.

- MMP9: This protein is associated with the pathological grading of gliomas and predicts poor prognosis. Patients with lower MMP9 expression are more likely to benefit from TMZ treatment, regardless of MGMT-methylation status.

- CXCR1: This chemokine receptor is significantly overexpressed in patients with glioma compared to normal individuals. It is involved in promoting neutrophil maturation, survival, and recruitment, and is associated with tumor-promoting activity.

The paper also mentions the potential of using these antigens as targets for immunotherapy, but does not provide specific details on their expression levels across different cancer types.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- PD1/PD-L1
- CTLA-4

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. The study suggests that high expression of REST may be associated with the expression of these immune checkpoints, which are known to play a role in tumor immune escape. The authors propose that targeting REST could potentially increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in glioma.

Additionally, the study mentions the following antigens in the context of immune cell infiltration in glioma:

- B cell biomarkers (CD19 and CD79A)
- CD4+ immune cell biomarker (CD4)
- M1 macrophage biomarkers (IRF5 and PTGS2)
- M2 macrophage biomarkers (CD163, VSIG4, and MS4A4A)
- Neutrophil biomarker (ITGAM)
- Dendritic cell biomarkers (HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DPA1, CD1C, NRP1, and ITGAX)

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but they are discussed in relation to immune cell infiltration and the tumor microenvironment in glioma.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and is involved in ECM remodeling and fibrogenesis. FAP is expressed at low to non-detectable levels in normal organs but is greatly upregulated at sites of tissue remodeling and tumor stroma.

- FAP is involved in various pathological processes and can be detected in more than 90% of malignant epithelial tumors. Targeting FAP is a promising approach for molecular imaging technologies, including positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), as FAP inhibitors exhibit rapid and almost complete internalization upon administration and rapid clearance from the circulation.

- FAP expression is associated with worse prognosis in colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and hepatocellular cancer. The first clinical application of FAP-based imaging involving the use of antibodies and boronic acid-based inhibitor molecules demonstrated limited clinical value due to the low blood clearance rate and limitations associated with gamma imaging.

- More recently, quinoline-based FAPIs have been developed as radiopharmaceuticals for PET/CT imaging. As a novel PET/CT tracer, FAPIs were compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in tumor detection rate and clinical efficiency, showing a higher sensitivity in identifying primary tumors and metastases involving lymph node, bone, and viscera.

- The novel imaging agent FAPI is currently applied during clinical practice to diagnose and manage several malignant tumors and their associated metastases. In this respect, Jiang et al. and Kuten et al. have observed a higher tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) in FAPI than in FDG, with little variations and fluctuations in the SUVmax in ovarian cancers and colorectal cancers.

- In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, FAP recognition and inhibition via 4-1 BB bispecific agonists have been proposed as a potential strategy for tumor-targeted therapy.
I have found no information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells.
I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- **Neuroligin-3 (NLGN3)**: NLGN3 is a synaptic adhesion molecule that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. It is secreted by neurons and OPCs during neuronal activity and is essential for the formation of functional synapses between neurons and glioma cells. NLGN3 has been proposed as a potential target for immunotherapy, as it is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is required for glioma progression.

- **Thrombospondin-3 (TSP3)**: TSP3 is a matricellular protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. It is involved in synaptogenesis and has been associated with glioma progression. TSP3 has been identified as a potential biomarker for glioma, and its expression levels have been found to correlate with preoperative global oscillatory brain activity.

- **Oligodendrocyte lineage genes (OLIG)**: OLIG genes, such as OLIG2, are expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells and are involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and glioma development. OLIG2 is a well-known marker for oligodendrocyte lineage cells and has been used to identify glioma cells in human glioblastoma.

- **Neural stem cell (NSC) markers**: NSCs are a potential cell-of-origin for glioma, and NSC markers, such as SOX2, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. NSCs are a promising target for immunotherapy, as they are involved in glioma initiation and progression.

- **Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) markers**: OPCs are another potential cell-of-origin for glioma, and OPC markers, such as NG2, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. OPCs are synaptogenic, proliferative, and plastic, and they have been shown to drive glioma development.

- **Glioma stem cell (GSC) markers**: GSCs are a subpopulation of glioma cells that are highly proliferative and are thought to drive glioma progression. GSC markers, such as CD133, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. GSCs are a promising target for immunotherapy, as they are involved in glioma initiation and progression.

These antigens have been proposed as potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor targeting in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as they are highly expressed in these cancer cells and are involved in glioma development and progression. However, further research is needed to validate their clinical utility and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular diagnostics:

- IDH1 R132H
- ATRX
- p53

These antigens are used as markers for specific mutations or alterations in glioma cells. For instance, IDH1 R132H is a mutation-specific marker for IDH1-mutant gliomas, while ATRX and p53 are associated with ATRX deficiency and p53 mutation, respectively.

The paper does not provide information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
