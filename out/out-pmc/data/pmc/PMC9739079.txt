- SELP (P-selectin): Overexpressed and oversecreted by IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, SELP has been linked to increased metastasis and spreading of melanoma and colon cancer cells via PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) mediated platelet activation. Blocking SELP function has been shown to delay tumor growth, prolong survival, and improve immune infiltration in vivo.
- PSGL-1: While PSGL-1 is considered a T cell immune checkpoint, it has also been implicated in aiding the spreading and metastasis of melanoma and colon cancer cells via P-selectin-mediated platelet activation. In glioblastoma, cancer cells overexpress and oversecrete SELP to exploit PSGL-1 signaling in glioma-associated microglia/macrophages.
- PD1: PD1 is expressed on intratumoral myeloid cells in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its expression is correlated with the accumulation of granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) during cancer-driven emergency myelopoiesis. Myeloid cell-specific PD1 ablation has been shown to increase Tem cells and improve their functionality, mediating anti-tumor immunity despite perceived PD1 expression on T cells.
- CTLA-4: CTLA-4 is expressed on circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells in cancer patients, including glioblastoma, and is associated with advanced disease and a negative prognosis independent of disease stage. The increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules on circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells likely reflects the immunosuppressive network in glioblastoma patients.
- GITR: GITR expression is increased on circulating CD4+ T cells in glioblastoma patients, which is linked to increased frequencies of regulatory T cell subsets and underlines the immune dysregulation in these patients.
- 2-HG (2-hydroxyglutarate): The oncometabolite 2-HG is released in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and contributes to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
- CD163: CD163 is overexpressed in parenchymal microglia/macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its increased expression is paralleled by increased expression of PSGL-1.
- CD206: CD206 is upregulated in the anti-inflammatory/pro-tumorigenic activation of microglia/macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- CD276 (B7-H3): CD276 is a solid tumor-associated antigen that is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages.
- HLA-DR: HLA-DR is downregulated on circulating monocytes in glioblastoma patients, and its expression is influenced by steroid medication.
- CD169: CD169 is expressed on macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- CD273 (PDL2): CD273 is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

These antigens are not only highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma but also play a role in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and the regulation of immune responses. Some of these antigens, such as SELP, PSGL-1, PD1, and CTLA-4, have been targeted in immunotherapy approaches, while others, like 2-HG, CD163, CD206, and CD276, have been implicated in tumor progression and immune evasion.
