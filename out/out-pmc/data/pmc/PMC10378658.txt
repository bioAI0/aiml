- HLA-A/B/C: These antigens are widely expressed on different cell types and are crucial for CD8+ T cells and NK cell-mediated antitumor effects. They are upregulated in 3D samples of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and have been found to be associated with immune regulatory mechanisms.
- HLA-E: This antigen is a tissue-restricted member of the non-classical HLA class Ib molecules and is more associated with the maternal immune response during pregnancy. It is upregulated in 3D samples and has been shown to have a role in the presentation of antigens to NK cells, mediating immune suppressive effects by blocking NK cell activity.
- HLA-G: This antigen is also a non-classical HLA class Ib molecule and is upregulated in 3D samples. It is associated with the maternal immune response and has been reported to have immune suppressive effects.
- MICA and MICB: These are homologous proteins of MHC class I molecules that are frequently and abundantly expressed on the surface of tumor cells. They bind to the NK cell receptor NKG2D and are upregulated in 3D samples of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- YHWA/14-3-3 family: Members of this family are part of the dynamic response to oxidative stress and are upregulated in 3D samples. They have an essential role in the DDR1 signaling cascade, which is linked to radio-chemoresistance.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
