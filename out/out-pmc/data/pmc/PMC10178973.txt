- PTPRZ1: PTPRZ1 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is also expressed in other cancer types, such as small-cell lung carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and uveal melanoma. PTPRZ1 has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in glioblastoma, as it is considered a canonical cancer stem cell marker. It has been included in an integrative analysis of the heterogeneity present in glioblastoma cancer stem cell populations, and a significant diversity of transcriptional profiles was observed between slow-cycling cells and cells expressing canonical cancer stem cell markers. PTPRZ1 has also been used as a target for immunotherapy in both HLA-A 02-positive and negative glioblastoma. The PTPRZ1 peptides, together with the rest of the HLA-A2-restricted tumor-associated antigens identified by peptidomics, have been used to formulate a multi-peptide vaccine (IMA950) that has entered phase I/II clinical trials for gliomas and showed spontaneous antigen-specific T-cell responses that were better in grade II and III compared to glioblastoma patients. Using an in-silico approach, another PTPRZ1 domain was found to induce the host's B- and T-cell immune response against glioblastoma and was fused with domains from other proteins to construct and characterize a multi-domain recombinant vaccine that will be validated by further in vitro and in vivo experimental studies.
- PTPRZ1-MET: PTPRZ1-MET is a fusion protein that has been identified in grade III astrocytomas or secondary glioblastomas. It is formed by the fusion of the carbonic anhydrase and the fibronectin type III domain of PTPRZ1 with the dimerization domain, immunoglobulin-like domains, transmembrane domain, and the tyrosine kinase domain of MET. The ZM fusion protein forms homodimers or heterodimers with wildtype MET, leading to enhanced MET tyrosine phosphorylation levels in the absence of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor, although the latter can further activate ZM autophosphorylation. GBMs harboring a ZM fusion exhibit a more aggressive phenotype and are associated with a poor patient prognosis. PTPRZ1-MET fusion proteins are also found in pediatric glioblastomas with enhanced MET expression and activity, sensitive to MET inhibitors. Exosomes from glioblastoma cells harboring the ZM fusion have higher MET expression and activity compared to those from non-ZM fusion glioblastoma cells, and they induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition when they are transferred to non-ZM fusion glioblastoma cells or normal human astrocytes.
- PTPRZ1-NFAM1: PTPRZ1-NFAM1 is a fusion gene that has been identified in two patients with spitzoid neoplasms, associated with a copy gain in the kinase fusion gene. NFAT-activated protein 1, which is the protein encoded by Nfam1, is a transmembrane receptor that regulates cytokine production and is mostly expressed in immune cells.
- PTPRZ1-ETV1: PTPRZ1-ETV1 is a fusion transcript that has been identified in 6% of the tested gliomas, including glioblastomas, one anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and one pilocytic astrocytoma. This fusion consists of the Ptprz1 promoter in frame with the highly conserved DNA-binding domain of the ETV1 transcription factor. The latter is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, known as oncogenic drivers in different types of tumors. To date, this fusion proteinâ€™s prognostic or therapeutic value is unknown.
- PTPRZ1-BRAF: PTPRZ1 has been identified as a BRAF fusion partner in juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, but information on the functional significance of this fusion protein is missing.

These antigens have been mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, as they are considered potential targets for immunotherapy or as biomarkers for the choice of the best therapeutic protocol or for selective targeting of cancer cells that overexpress them.
