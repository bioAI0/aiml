- PTPRZ1: PTPRZ1 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is also expressed in other cancer types, such as small-cell lung carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and uveal melanoma. PTPRZ1 has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in both HLA-A 02-positive and negative glioblastoma. The PTPRZ1 peptides, along with other HLA-A2-restricted tumor-associated antigens, have been used to formulate a multi-peptide vaccine (IMA950) that has entered phase I/II clinical trials for gliomas. This vaccine has shown spontaneous antigen-specific T-cell responses, which were better in grade II and III compared to GBM patients.
- PTPRZ1-MET fusion protein: This fusion protein is found in grade III astrocytomas or secondary glioblastomas and is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor patient prognosis. The ZM fusion protein forms homodimers or heterodimers with wildtype MET, leading to enhanced MET tyrosine phosphorylation levels. The ZM fusion protein has been described to contain sequences encoding the carbonic anhydrase and the fibronectin type III domain of PTPRZ1 fused to the dimerization domain, immunoglobulin-like domains, transmembrane domain, and the tyrosine kinase domain of MET.
- PTPRZ1-NFAM1 fusion gene: This fusion gene has been identified in two patients with spitzoid neoplasms, associated with a copy gain in the kinase fusion gene. The protein encoded by Nfam1 is a transmembrane receptor that regulates cytokine production and is mostly expressed in immune cells.
- PTPRZ1-ETV1 fusion: This fusion has been identified in 6% of the tested gliomas, including GBMs, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and pilocytic astrocytoma. The fusion consists of the Ptprz1 promoter in frame with the highly conserved DNA-binding domain of the ETV1 transcription factor, which is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors known as oncogenic drivers in different types of tumors.
- PTPRZ1-BRAF fusion: This fusion has been identified in juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, but information on its functional significance is missing.
- PTPRZ1-VEGFA: VEGFA competes with PTN for PTPRZ1 binding, and both PTN and VEGFA seem to activate similar signaling downstream of the receptor. The monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, which binds to VEGFA and inhibits its binding to its VEGF receptors 1 and 2, does not affect binding to PTPRZ1, suggesting that the VEGF receptor-binding domain of VEGFA is not involved in PTPRZ1 binding. The heparin-binding domain of VEGFA is also not involved, and the VEGFA domain that interacts with PTPRZ1 is still to be identified.
- PTPRZ1-IL34: IL34 binds to PTPRZ1 in a CS-dependent manner, at a site or sites that are different from the PTN-binding sites, based on the observation that PTN does not compete with IL34 for PTPRZ1 binding.
- PTPRZ1-FGF2: FGF2 has been identified as a PTPRZ1 ligand that binds PTPRZ1 with high affinity. Binding was not affected by the chondroitinase treatment of phosphacan, suggesting that it takes place on the protein core of the receptor. However, this interaction and its potential functional significance in the nervous or other systems, physiology, or pathology, has not been studied further.
- PTPRZ1-VacA: The Helicobacter pylori exotoxin VacA, which is responsible for gastric injury, has been identified as a PTPRZ1 ligand. VacA interacts with the PTPRZ1 protein core sequence QTTQP at positions 747–751, which is distinct from the PTN-binding site(s).
- PTPRZ1-PTN: PTN is the first PTPRZ1-soluble ligand identified. It binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor in U373-MG cells, leading to its dimerization and inactivation of its TP activity. The result of this inactivation has been the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, resulting in an impaired association between β-catenin and Ν-cadherin, disrupted cell-to-cell adhesion complexes, initiation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tumor development and progression. In fetal human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, exogenous PTN or Ptprz1 gene deletion strongly potentiated cell proliferation mediated by the tonic activation of β-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent transcription. In renal cell carcinoma cell lines, β-catenin has been found to co-immunoprecipitate with PTPRZ1, and downregulation of PTPRZ1 by siRNA led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and a significant decrease of nuclear β-catenin, leading to decreased cell proliferation. However, in another study in human renal cell carcinoma cells, PTPRZ1 was shown to increase nuclear β-catenin protein levels and enhance cell proliferation. Overexpression of PTPRZ1 promotes the malignant transformation of oral submucous fibrosis, at least partly, through its effect on β-catenin phosphorylation. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), tyrosine phosphorylation or localization of β-catenin was unaltered following PTN stimulation.
- PTPRZ1-MK: MK, which belongs to the same protein family as PTN, was also found to bind PTPRZ1. Both PTN and MK have low- and high-affinity binding sites on PTPRZ1, and at least one of the binding sites depends on PTPRZ1 glycosylation. The PTN or MK domains that bind to PTPRZ1 have not been identified. The carboxyterminal unstructured domain of PTN has been suggested to mediate this interaction, although this has not been verified in all types of cells, and this domain has no similarity between PTN and MK. In MK, Arg78 at its C-terminal thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) domain plays an essential role in high-affinity binding to CS moieties on PTPRZ1.
- PTPRZ1-α4β1, α6β1, and ανβ3 integrins: These integrins were found to directly interact with PTPRZ1 in normal and cancer cells. The interaction of ανβ3 with PTPRZ1 in endothelial cells is independent of the presence of any ligand. PTPRZ1 also interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) ectodomain and with nucleolin, but mechanistic aspects or the functional significance of these interactions remain unknown.
- PTPRZ1-N-CAM and Ng-CAM: These cellular proteins were found to interact with the soluble PTPRZ1 isoform phosphacan in the nervous system. Those early studies showed that the extracellular PTPRZ1 domain interacts with the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and the neuron-glia CAM (Ng-CAM), but not with extracellular matrix proteins. Low levels of interaction were seen only with collagens I, II, VI, and tenascin. Specific and high-affinity interaction of tenascin with phosphacan was also found in another study. These interactions seem to be mediated by asparagine-linked oligosaccharides present in the carbonic anhydrase- and FNIII-like domains of PTPRZ1/phosphacan.
- PTPRZ1-contactin: Another neuronal cell adhesion protein, contactin, interacts with the carbonic anhydrase domain of PTPRZ1 and may generate unidirectional or bidirectional signals during neural development.
- PTPRZ1-F3: Another CAM of the Ig superfamily, F3 on neurons, has also been found to interact with PTPRZ1 on Schwann cells, affecting peripheral nerve development and regeneration.
- PTPRZ1-voltage-gated sodium channels: In brain neurons, besides cell adhesion molecules, the short-transmembrane PTPRZ1 isoform and phosphacan have been found to associate with voltage-gated sodium channels through their carbonic anhydrase domain and affect sodium ion currents. PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates voltage-gated sodium channels, and this modification positively shifts their voltage dependence, slows sodium channel inactivation, and increases the whole-cell sodium current.
- PTPRZ1-β-adducin: β-adducin was found to interact with the intracellular PTPRZ1 domain in a yeast two-hybrid system. In Hela cells stimulated by PTN, β-adducin phosphorylation is increased, leading to disrupted actin/spectrin/β-adducin complexes, and loss of stabilized cytoskeleton and homophilic cell–cell adhesion.
- PTPRZ1-Fyn: The Src TK family member Fyn was found to interact with the intracellular domain of PTPRZ1. PTN binding to PTPRZ1 in Hela and GBM stem cells leads to a sharp increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn, suggesting that Fyn is a PTPRZ1 substrate. However, in the spinal cord of Ptprz1-deficient C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and in mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells, it was shown that there were no significant differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn related to PTPRZ1.
- PTPRZ1-c-Src: Another member of the same TK family, c-Src, has also been found to co-immunoprecipitate with PTPRZ1 and is activated upon PTN binding to PTPRZ1 in HUVEC.
- PTPRZ1-p190 Rho GAP: The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho GTPase, p190 Rho GAP, has also been shown to be a PTPRZ1 substrate based on the observations that: (a) in Ptprz1-deficient C57BL/6 mice, phosphorylation of Tyr1105 on p190 Rho GAP is not affected by fear conditioning, while in the corresponding wildtype mice, it was decreased, and (b) PTN increases phosphorylation of p190 Rho GAP at Tyr1105 in B103 neuroblastoma cells in a PTPRZ1-dependent manner. In the spinal cord of Ptprz1-deficient C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Tyr1105 phosphorylation in p190 Rho GAP was independent of Fyn, supporting the notion that p190 Rho GAP is a PTPRZ1 substrate. PTPRZ1-dependent and Fyn-independent p190 Rho GAP Tyr1105 phosphorylation has also been shown in mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells.
- PTPRZ1-ErbB4: The neuregulin receptor ErbB4, which is a member of the ErbB-family TKs, has been found to functionally interact with the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region of PTPRZ1 in adult rat synaptosomes, and in cell bodies and apical dendrites of neurons in the prefrontal cortex. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 is increased in Ptprz1-deficient C57BL/6 mice, repressed in HEK293T cells following PTPRZ1 overexpression, and decreased in mice overexpressing PTPRZ1. PTPRZ1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 was also observed following PTN stimulation of mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells. The functional PTPRZ1–ErbB4 interaction seems to be mediated by the scaffolding membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW, and PDZ domain-containing (MAGI)-1 and MAGI-3 proteins that have been previously shown to bind to PTPRZ1 through their PDZ4 domain. ErbB4 seems to interact with the PDZ1 domain of the MAGI proteins. PTPRZ1 has been shown to dephosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated MAGI-1 and to decrease ErbB4-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of MAGI-1 and MAGI-2 in H4 human neuroglioma cells.
- PTPRZ1-GIT1/Cat-1: G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 1/Cool-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated 1 (GIT1/Cat-1) has been identified to bind to and be a PTPRZ1 substrate using the yeast substrate-trapping system. This interaction was verified in mammalian cells and the hippocampus and neocortex in the rat brain, and PTN increased tyrosine phosphorylation of GIT1/Cat-1 in B103 neuroblastoma and mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells.
- PTPRZ1-paxillin: Paxillin has also been verified as a physiological PTPRZ1 substrate based on the typical substrate motif for the catalytic domain of PTPRZ1, which was deduced to be Glu/Asp-Glu/Asp-Glu/Asp-Xaa-Ile/Val-Tyr(P)-Xaa (Xaa is not an acidic residue). This substrate motif is present in the major phosphorylation site of paxillin at Tyr-118, and PTPRZ1 was found to efficiently dephosphorylate paxillin at this site in cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was also increased following PTN treatment of mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells.
- PTPRZ1-NYAP2: The neuronal tyrosine-phosphorylated phosphoinositide-3-kinase adaptor 2 (NYAP2) has also been suggested to be a PTPRZ1 substrate. In support of this, PTN treatment of mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells increased the NYAP2 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, it was not clarified whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of NYAP2 was a direct effect of PTPRZ1 TP activity or was mediated by other PTPRZ1-related TKs, such as Fyn. Phosphorylated NYAPs interact with the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) p85 subunit and activate PI3K, Akt, Rac1, and WAVE1 signaling, many of which have also been shown to be activated downstream of PTPRZ1.
- PTPRZ1-AFAP1L2/XB130: Another adaptor protein involved in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, actin filament-associated protein 1-like 2 (AFAP1L2/XB130), is also a PTPRZ1 substrate, as shown in cell-free assays as well as in HEK293T cells. In mouse oligodendrocyte-lineage OL1 cells, PTN induces AFAP1L2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and this is a prerequisite for the PTN-induced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation.
- PTPRZ1-PI3K and/or Akt: Regulation of PI3K and/or Akt downstream of PTPRZ1 is one of the most extensively observed signaling pathways. In human embryonic stem cells, PTN activates Akt in a PTPRZ1-dependent manner, thus enhancing cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. In the same line, in GBM stem cells, PTN activates the PI3K/Akt pathway in a PTPRZ1- and Fyn-dependent manner. PTN stimulates oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation partly through the PTPRZ1-dependent AFAP1L2 tyrosine phosphorylation, which then leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In ovarian cancer cells, PTPRZ1 negatively regulates Akt kinase activity, in line with data on mouse Ptprz1−/− lung endothelial cells and tumors, that have increased levels of activated Akt compared to the corresponding wildtype. In HUVEC, PTN and VEGFA165 activate PI3K downstream of PTPRZ1, and PI3K is required for both cell surface nucleolin localization and cell migration.
- PTPRZ1-β3 integrin: In HUVEC, binding of PTN or VEGFA165 to PTPRZ1 leads to phosphorylation of β3 integrin on Tyr773 upstream of PI3K activation, cell surface nucleolin localization, and enhanced cell migration. Although β3 integrin expression seems to be required for enhanced migration of endothelial cells by PTN, PTPRZ1- and PI3K-dependent, c-Src- and ανβ3-independent, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activation by PTN is also required for PTN-induced HUVEC migration. Through the cell membrane functional complex of ανβ3 and PTPRZ1, PTN also activates xanthine oxidase to produce signaling levels of reactive oxygen species, required for PTN-induced endothelial and prostate cancer cell migration.
- PTPRZ1-NFκΒ: In triple-negative breast cancer cells, NFκΒ is activated downstream of PTPRZ1 following PTN binding, although the signaling that leads to NFκΒ activation is not clarified. In HEK293 cells, transient transfection with either long or short PTPRZ1 isoforms has been shown to activate NFκΒ reporter gene transcription. PTPRZ1 seems to negatively regulate the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), and in Ptprz1-deficient mice, the aberrant activation of ROCK results in enhanced long-term potentiation and learning impairments in the animal. There is also an observation that suggests that PTN targets N-cadherin for proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway in a PTPRZ1-dependent manner, but this needs to be further and specifically studied.
- PTPRZ1-ALK: PTPRZ1 has been shown to dephosphorylate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) autophosphorylation sites, an effect that is inhibited upon PTN binding to PTPRZ1 that leads to enhanced ALK tyrosine phosphorylation. However, it has not been shown whether PTPRZ1 directly interacts with ALK, and attempts to detect such interaction in endothelial cells have been unsuccessful.
- PTPRZ1-TrkA: PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates the neurotrophins' receptor TrkA, but not TrkB or TrkC, and attenuates TrkA activation induced by nerve growth factor in vivo. In the brain of Ptprz1−/− mice, tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was significantly elevated.
- PTPRZ1-TrkB or TrkC: PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates the neurotrophins' receptor TrkA, but not TrkB or TrkC, and attenuates TrkA activation induced by nerve growth factor in vivo. In the brain of Ptprz1−/− mice, tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was significantly elevated.
- PTPRZ1-TrkA: PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates the neurotrophins' receptor TrkA, but not TrkB or TrkC, and attenuates TrkA activation induced by nerve growth factor in vivo. In the brain of Ptprz1−/− mice, tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was significantly elevated.
- PTPRZ1-TrkB or TrkC: PTPRZ1 dephosphorylates the neurotrophins' receptor TrkA, but not TrkB or
