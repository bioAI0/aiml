I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
- CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4)
- PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha)
- DDIT3 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3)
- KIT (KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase)

These antigens are mentioned in the context of their expression levels across different cancer types, with the article noting that they are found at varying frequencies in glioblastoma cases. For example, EGFR is amplified in 47.9% of cases, CDK4 in 18.2%, PDGFRA in 14.2%, DDIT3 in 10.8%, and KIT in 10.8%.

The article also discusses the potential implications of these antigens for immunotherapy and tumor targeting. It highlights that the knockout of some of these genes, such as EGFR and CDK4, can significantly impact the proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines. This suggests that targeting these antigens with immunotherapeutic approaches could be a promising strategy for treating IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

However, the article does not provide specific details about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their potential as immunotherapy targets. Further research and validation would be required to fully explore these aspects.
