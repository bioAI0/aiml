The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- gp96 (glucose-regulated protein 96): Overexpressed in grade IV gliomas, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Its expression is associated with increased malignancy and worse clinical outcomes. gp96-selective inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies are under development as potential treatments.
- HSP90 (heat shock protein 90): gp96 belongs to the HSP90 family, and its expression is associated with various malignancies, including gliomas.
- GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein): Used as a marker for glioma cells in the study.
- CD4, CD8, and PD-1: These immune cell markers are used to assess T cell infiltration in gliomas. Their densities are associated with clinical outcomes and can be influenced by gp96 expression.
- IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase): A mutation status used to classify gliomas, with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas showing higher gp96 expression and worse outcomes.

The paper also discusses the potential of using gp96-peptide complexes as a vaccine (HSPPC-96 vaccine) to treat various cancers, including glioblastoma. The vaccine has shown promising results in early clinical studies, and the authors suggest that understanding the impact of gp96 expression and its association with immune cell infiltration could provide insights into vaccine immunity and help identify responsive patients.
