I have carefully reviewed the provided text and found no explicit mention of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The text primarily focuses on the development and evaluation of the Digital Case Manager, a data-driven tool to support family caregivers, and does not delve into the specific antigens or their expression levels in different cancer types. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information based on the given text.
