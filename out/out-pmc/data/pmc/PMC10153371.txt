I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR
- MGMT
- ATRX
- p53
- Ki67

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as predictive markers for glioblastoma patient survival. The study also highlights the importance of considering the use of steroids for the symptomatic relief of glioblastoma patients, as steroids can influence immune cell activity and affect the expression of these antigens.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it is worth noting that the study focuses on glioblastoma, a specific type of brain tumor, and the expression of these antigens may vary in other cancer types.
