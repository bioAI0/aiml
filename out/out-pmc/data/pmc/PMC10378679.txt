I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- CDKN2A/B: The CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes are located on the short arm of chromosome 9 and encode for proteins that regulate cell growth and angiogenesis. CDKN2A/B homozygous deletions (HD) are associated with decreased survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, and the presence of these deletions is a poor prognostic factor.
- CDK4: CDK4 amplification is associated with poor overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.
- PDGFRA: PDGFRA amplification is associated with poor overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.
- TERT: TERT promoter mutations are associated with poor overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.
- ATRX: ATRX loss is associated with poor overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.
- p53: p53 expression is associated with poor overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of their expression levels and prognostic significance in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. The paper also discusses the potential of using CDKN2A/B HD as a molecular marker for grading and survival in IDH-mutant astrocytomas, but it does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
