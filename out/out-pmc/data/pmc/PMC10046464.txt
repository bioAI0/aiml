I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- TERT promoter mutations: Detectable in 56.3% of IDH wild-type patients, these mutations are associated with glioblastoma driver mutations.
- Nestin: A protein expressed in neural stem cells and glioblastoma stem cells, nestin is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation.
- CD133: A cell surface marker associated with cancer stem cells, CD133 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been linked to tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy.
- CD44: A cell adhesion molecule, CD44 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis.
- SOX2: A transcription factor involved in maintaining stem cell properties, SOX2 is expressed in glioblastoma stem cells and has been associated with tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and their potential role in tumor development and progression. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the molecular characteristics of glioblastoma, particularly in relation to the subventricular zone, for the development of targeted therapies.

Regarding their expression levels across different cancer types, the paper does not provide specific information. However, it is worth noting that these antigens are not exclusive to glioblastoma and may be expressed in other cancer types as well. For example, CD133 is a well-known marker for cancer stem cells in various solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer. Similarly, CD44 is widely expressed in many cancer types and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper does not provide direct information. However, the identification of these antigens and their association with glioblastoma stem cells could have implications for the development of targeted therapies. For instance, targeting these antigens with specific antibodies or small molecules could potentially inhibit the growth and spread of glioblastoma stem cells, leading to improved treatment outcomes. Additionally, the study's findings suggest that the subventricular zone, a region rich in neural stem cells, may play a crucial role in glioblastoma pathogenesis and resistance to therapy. This knowledge could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target the subventricular zone and its associated stem cell populations.
