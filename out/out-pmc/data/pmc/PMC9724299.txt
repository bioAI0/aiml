- PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1): PD-L1 is a checkpoint protein that is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. It is a potential target for immunotherapy, as higher risk scores were significantly associated with upregulation of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1.
- CD276: CD276 is another immune checkpoint protein that is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is also associated with a poor prognosis, and its expression is significantly correlated with higher risk scores.
- CD44: CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. It is expressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma, and its expression is significantly correlated with higher risk scores in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is associated with a poor prognosis and a higher risk of recurrence compared to IDH-mutant glioblastoma.
- The study suggests that the developed prognostic model, based on risk scores, could be used as a potential biomarker for risk stratification and treatment response prediction in glioblastoma patients.
- The prognostic model was constructed using 10Ã— scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data, and it effectively classified patients into high- and low-risk groups based on their risk scores.
- The study also explored the relationship between risk scores, TMB values, and PD-L1 expression levels, but found no significant correlation between higher risk scores and higher TMB values.
