I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- **Neuroligin-3 (NLGN3)**: NLGN3 is a synaptic adhesion molecule that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. It is secreted by neurons and OPCs during neuronal activity and is essential for the formation of functional synapses between neurons and glioma cells. NLGN3 has been proposed as a potential target for immunotherapy, as it is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is required for glioma progression.

- **Thrombospondin-3 (TSP3)**: TSP3 is a matricellular protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. It is involved in synaptogenesis and has been associated with glioma progression. TSP3 has been identified as a potential biomarker for glioma, and its expression levels have been found to correlate with preoperative global oscillatory brain activity.

- **Oligodendrocyte lineage genes (OLIG)**: OLIG genes, such as OLIG2, are expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells and are involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and glioma development. OLIG2 is a well-known marker for oligodendrocyte lineage cells and has been used to identify glioma cells in human glioblastoma.

- **Neural stem cell (NSC) markers**: NSCs are a potential cell-of-origin for glioma, and NSC markers, such as SOX2, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. NSCs are a promising target for immunotherapy, as they are involved in glioma initiation and progression.

- **Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) markers**: OPCs are another potential cell-of-origin for glioma, and OPC markers, such as NG2, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. OPCs are synaptogenic, proliferative, and plastic, and they have been shown to drive glioma development.

- **Glioma stem cell (GSC) markers**: GSCs are a subpopulation of glioma cells that are highly proliferative and are thought to drive glioma progression. GSC markers, such as CD133, have been found to be expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells. GSCs are a promising target for immunotherapy, as they are involved in glioma initiation and progression.

These antigens have been proposed as potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor targeting in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as they are highly expressed in these cancer cells and are involved in glioma development and progression. However, further research is needed to validate their clinical utility and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.
