- CD161-encoding gene KLRB1: This antigen is expressed by a population of cytotoxic TILs in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Inactivation of KLRB1 or antibody-mediated CD161 blockade resulted in increased T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro and an enhanced response in vivo.
- HER2, IL-13Rα2, and EphA2: These antigens are being targeted by bi- or tri-CAR T-cell approaches in murine models of GBM.
- Survivin: A vaccine approach targeting the oncoprotein survivin has had moderate success in recurrent GBM and warrants further exploration of other vaccine targets. Survivin is an antiapoptotic protein expressed by many tumor types, including GBM. Its expression in GBM has been associated with increased recurrence, chemotherapy resistance, and poor overall prognosis. The SurVaxM vaccine contains a synthetic long peptide mimic that spans the human survivin protein sequence; it expresses MHC Class I epitopes and stimulates the MHC Class II-restricted T-cell responses required for cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell activity against tumors. A Phase I trial of SurVaxM against recurrent GBM demonstrated no serious adverse events and prolonged overall survival following vaccination (86.6 weeks) compared with historical overall survival (30 weeks). A subsequent study identified that glioma patients routinely expressed elevated serum levels of CD9+/GFAP+/SVN+ exosomes, associated with tumor progression, compared with healthy controls. Patients treated with antisurvivin therapy showed decreased levels of these exosomes. Monitoring of CD9+/GFAP+/SVN+ exosomes may be a promising adjunct to the use of MRI in disease surveillance. Current trials are underway to evaluate SurVaxM’s efficacy in newly diagnosed GBM.
- EGFRvIII: This antigen is targeted by CAR T-cell therapy in EGFRvIII-positive recurrent glioblastoma. Although EGFRvIII-targeted CAR T-cells found their way from peripheral blood to the tumor, no meaningful response was detected. This lack of response to anti-EGFRvIII CAR T-cells may be attributable to the significant intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of EGFRvIII expression in glioblastoma as well as to adaptive changes in the local TME, which include changes in antigen expression over time. For instance, following treatment, EGFRvIII was lost in a group of patients.
- IDH1: A vaccine targeting mutant IDH1 in newly diagnosed glioma has shown promising results, with vaccine-induced immune responses observed in 93.3% of patients and no regime-limiting toxicity observed. The 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 63% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year progression-free rate among patients with an immune response was 82%, while the two patients without an immune response had tumor progression within 2 years of diagnosis.
- Cancer germline antigens: These are non-mutated targets with low expression levels in glioblastoma.
- Neoantigens: Only a few mutation-derived neoantigens have been predicted in glioma.
