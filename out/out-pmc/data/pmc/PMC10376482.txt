I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
- Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT)

EGFR is mentioned in the context of immunotherapy, as it is a target for monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. TERT is not mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
