The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- **PD-1**: The paper discusses the use of PD-1 checkpoint inhibition in recurrent glioblastoma, specifically in the context of hypermutant glioblastoma resulting from germline biallelic mismatch repair deficiency.
- **PD-L1**: The PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab is mentioned as a treatment option for recurrent glioblastoma, with clinical activity and safety data presented.
- **CTLA-4**: The CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab is mentioned as a potential treatment for recurrent glioblastoma, but no specific data is provided.
- **EGFR**: The paper describes the use of EGFR kinase inhibition in glioblastoma, with molecular characteristics correlated with sensitivity to this treatment.
- **PDGFRA**: Similar to EGFR, the paper explores the amplification of PDGFRA in glioblastoma and its potential as a therapeutic target.

These antigens are not explicitly stated to have strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, but their mention in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting suggests they may be relevant to this cancer type.
