- CD73: CD73 is a core purinergic effector that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with EGFR amplification, astrocyte-like differentiation, and increased adenosine levels, and is linked to hypoxia. CD73 expression is also correlated with poor outcomes. CD73 is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting, as it is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells and is associated with poor outcomes.
- EGFR: EGFR is a lineage-encoded driver of glioblastoma that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with CD73 expression and is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting.
- PDGFRA: PDGFRA is a lineage-encoded driver of glioblastoma that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with CD73 expression and is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting.
- CD39: CD39 is a core purinergic effector that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with tumor-associated microglia and myeloid cells and is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting.
- CD163: CD163 is a marker of microglia and tumor-associated myeloid cells that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with CD39 expression and is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting.
- CD11b: CD11b is a marker of microglia and tumor-associated myeloid cells that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with CD39 expression and is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting.
- HIF1A: HIF1A is a marker of hypoxia that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with CD73 expression and is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting.
- GLUT1: GLUT1 is a marker of hypoxia that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with CD73 expression and is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting.
- ARG1: ARG1 is a marker of hypoxia that is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with CD73 expression and is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting.
