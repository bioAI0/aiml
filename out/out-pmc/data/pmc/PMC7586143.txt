- ATRX: The loss of ATRX expression was more frequent in TERTp wild-type GBM, but this difference was not significant.
- CD133: The expression of CD133 was associated with the pattern and timing of primary GBM recurrence. It was also significantly associated with multifocal lesions.
- p53: TP53 gene mutations and/or strong immunoreactivity of p53 were found in 43.4% of patients.
- Ki-67: The Ki-67 labeling index was determined by immunohistochemical staining, with a mean of 33.8% in the study population.
- MGMT: MGMT gene promoter methylation was found in 40.5% of patients and was associated with longer PFS and OS.

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in this paper. However, they are known to be highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies.
