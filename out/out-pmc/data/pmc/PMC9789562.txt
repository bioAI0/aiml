- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): FAP is a novel target for molecular-based PET imaging, which has shown promising results in various tumors, including glioblastoma. FAP is overexpressed in most glioblastomas, especially in the mesenchymal subtype, and is associated with FAP-positive vessels, foci of neoplastic cells, and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. The study found that 18F-FAPI PET/CT detected 69.6% of all lesions in glioblastoma patients, with a 100% positive predictive value. However, the study did not find any correlation between FAP expression and PET/CT parameters, and some lesions were not labeled with FAP on immunohistochemistry.

- Ki-67: Ki-67 is a marker of cell proliferation and is often used as a prognostic marker in glioblastoma. The study found that the Ki-67 index was not correlated with the FAPI-PET/CT parameters, such as MGMT promoter methylation, TERT, and IDH mutation. However, the study also noted that only one of the glioblastoma patients had IDH mutation, which may have limited the ability to detect correlations.

- IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.
