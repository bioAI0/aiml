- GFAP (+++): Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein is a marker for astrocytic differentiation and is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is used as a diagnostic marker and has been explored as a potential target for immunotherapy, with studies investigating the use of GFAP-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.

- S100 (++): S100 is a calcium-binding protein that is expressed in various cell types, including glial cells. It is often used as a marker for glial tumors and has been studied in the context of immunotherapy, with S100-specific CAR T cells showing potential in preclinical models.

- Vimentin (++): Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein associated with mesenchymal differentiation. Its expression is higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma compared to IDH-mutant glioblastoma. Vimentin has been investigated as a potential target for immunotherapy, with vimentin-specific CAR T cells showing antitumor activity in preclinical studies.

- Nestin (+++): Nestin is a marker of neuroepithelial stem cells and is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is associated with a high histopathological degree and poor prognosis. Nestin-based immunotherapy approaches are being explored, including the development of Nestin-specific CAR T cells.

- ATRX (++): Alpha-Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked protein is involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. ATRX alterations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its expression can be used as a diagnostic marker. Immunotherapy strategies targeting ATRX have not been extensively studied.

- Synaptophysin (+++): Synaptophysin is a synaptic vesicle protein and a marker for neuroendocrine differentiation. It is expressed in various tumor types, including glioblastoma. While not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, synaptophysin-based immunotherapy has been explored for other cancer types.

- Ki-67 (20%): Ki-67 is a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation. A high Ki-67 index is often correlated with aggressive tumor behavior. Immunotherapy strategies targeting Ki-67 have not been widely reported, but its expression is an important prognostic factor in various cancers.
