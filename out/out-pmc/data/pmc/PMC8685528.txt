I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- **EGFRvIII:** EGFRvIII is a mutated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is commonly found in glioblastoma. It is associated with poor prognosis and is a potential target for immunotherapy. The study mentions that EGFRvIII is a GBM-specific antigen and suggests that it could be used as a biomarker for prognosis.

- **MGMT:** MGMT is a DNA repair enzyme that is often methylated in glioblastoma, leading to impaired DNA repair and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. The study highlights the importance of MGMT as a prognostic marker, especially in combination with other factors like IDH1 and MGMT promoter methylation status.

- **miR-21 and miR-10b:** These are microRNAs that are upregulated in glioblastoma and have been proposed as potential biomarkers for prognosis. The study suggests that these microRNAs are associated with the stemness of cancer cells and could be used for tumor targeting.

The study does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it emphasizes the importance of these antigens in glioblastoma and their potential as targets for immunotherapy and tumor targeting strategies.
