- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): This antigen is highly expressed on the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of the tumor stroma in various tumor entities, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. FAP contributes to tumor progression and a worse prognosis. It is a promising biomarker and target for medical interventions, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs): CAFs are a heterogeneous cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and their presence is associated with resistance to immunotherapy in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CAFs can have different origins, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, resident tissue fibroblasts, and adipocytes.
- Integrin b1/CD29, α-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), PDGFR-β (platelet-derived growth factor receptor β), CAV1 (caveolin 1), and S100-A4/FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1): These markers are used to classify CAF subpopulations (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1 (CAF-S1 FAP+), which is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2): HER2 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. HER2 expression is associated with a poor prognosis and is a target for immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor): EGFR is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. EGFR is a target for immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- CXCL12β (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12β) and CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4): These molecules are involved in the initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and distant metastatic processes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CXCL12β is secreted by CAF-S1, and CXCR4 is expressed in cancer cells.
- PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) and PD-L2 (programmed cell death ligand 2): These ligands are expressed by CAFs from various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. They are targets for immunotherapy, including anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-L2 immunotherapies.
- GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1): GLUT1 expression is commonly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with an inability to express an EMT phenotype.

The paper also mentions the following in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting:

- CAF-S1 FAP+ promotes an immunosuppressive environment by secreting CXCL12β, increasing T cell survival, and promoting the differentiation of CD25+FOXP3+ cells.
- CAF-S1 FAP+ is associated with resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and reduces antitumor immunity.
- CAFs from IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and other cancer types have shown expression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2, particularly the CAF-S1 FAP+ subset.
- The CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation is an important source of CXCL12 secretion, which plays a crucial role in resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer.
- Targeted CAF therapy can potentially inhibit metastasis and cancer progression by reducing immunosuppression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment.
- The dynamic behavior of FAP is associated with its functions in the progression phase during cancer evolution, including tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, promotion of tumor proliferation, and immunomodulation.
- Additional clinical studies are needed to define the clinical impact of the non-invasive in vivo detection of FAP in newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients and its implication in determining candidates for immunotherapy and target therapy combined with conventional therapies.
