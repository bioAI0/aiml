I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGR4
- PAPPA
- LRRC3
- ANXA3

These antigens were found to be significantly up-regulated in the TMZ-resistant group of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The expression level of these genes was also observed to be higher in recurrent GBMs and the TMZ-resistant sectors of the TMZ-ITH patients, suggesting their role in contributing to TMZ resistance.

The paper also mentions that the expression level of the four TMZ-resistant markers predicted poor survival not only in the study cohort but also in an independent IDH-wt GBM cohort extracted from the TCGA dataset. This indicates that these antigens could be potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

However, the paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
