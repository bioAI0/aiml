I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- CDKN2A
- EGFR

CDKN2A is a gene that encodes two tumor suppressors, protein p14ARF and p16INK4A. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A can contribute to uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation and has been reported as a poor prognostic marker in adult glioma. CDKN2A homozygous deletion is also observed in pediatric gliomas, and is a well-known hallmark lesion of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. CDKN2A homozygous deletion co-occurs with the BRAF V600E mutation, demonstrating poor clinical outcomes.

EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently amplified and overexpressed in glioblastoma. It is a well-known oncogene that plays a critical role in the development and progression of glioblastoma. EGFR amplification and overexpression are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, CDKN2A and EGFR have been mentioned as potential targets for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies. CDKN2A has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in glioblastoma, and EGFR has been targeted with monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors in clinical trials.
