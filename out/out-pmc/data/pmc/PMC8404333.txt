- **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**: EGFR is frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma, with amplification and overexpression associated with poor prognosis, especially in young patients. EGFR amplification is closely associated with wild-type IDH1/2, and EGFR overexpression is significantly elevated in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM samples. However, EGFR amplification is not a significant prognostic factor for IDH1/2-wild-type GBM patients.
- **LANCL2 (Lanthionine Synthetase C-Like 2)**: LANCL2 is a homologue of prokaryotic LanC, involved in lantibiotics synthesis. It is a receptor for abscisic acid, an endogenous mammalian hormone, and can increase tumor cell sensitivity to adriamycin. LANCL2 amplification is an independent prognostic factor for younger glioblastoma patients, but not for IDH1/2-wild-type GBM patients.
- **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)**: TERT promoter mutation is found in approximately 80% of primary GBM patients and is associated with poor survival. However, there is no specific mention of TERT expression levels in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM.
- **TP53**: TP53 mutation is associated with glioblastoma, but there is no specific information about its expression levels in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM.
- **MGMT (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)**: MGMT promoter methylation is a prognostic marker in glioblastoma, but there is no direct correlation between MGMT expression and IDH1/2-wild-type status.

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text. However, EGFR and LANCL2 are extensively studied in glioblastoma, and their amplification and overexpression are potential diagnostic and prognostic markers. TERT, TP53, and MGMT are also important molecular markers in glioblastoma with prognostic significance.
