- **Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)**: EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently amplified and overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies. EGFR amplification is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in glioblastoma.

- **Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT)**: TERT is a catalytic subunit of telomerase, which is an enzyme that maintains telomere length and promotes cellular immortality. TERT promoter mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased telomerase activity and poor prognosis. TERT is a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting approaches.

- **Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B)**: CDKN2A/B are tumor suppressor genes that encode the proteins p16INK4A and p14ARF, respectively. These proteins regulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B is associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT is a DNA repair enzyme that removes alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine, thereby reversing the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents like temozolomide. MGMT promoter methylation status is a critical factor in predicting response to temozolomide in glioblastoma. MGMT expression is associated with resistance to temozolomide and poor prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

- **Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH)**: IDH is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to Î±-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. IDH mutations are common in gliomas, and IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. IDH mutations are also associated with increased sensitivity to metformin, as mentioned in the paper.

- **p53**: p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and DNA repair. p53 mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **ATRX**: ATRX is a chromatin remodeler that is involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. ATRX mutations are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and poor prognosis.

- **PTEN**: PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. PTEN mutations or deletions are common in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

- **p16 and p14**: p16 and p14 are tumor suppressor proteins encoded by the CDKN2A/B gene. p16 (INK4A) inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, while p14 (ARF) stabilizes p53. Homozygous deletion of p16 and p14 is associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is linked to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis.

These antigens are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are associated with tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and poor prognosis. They are potential targets for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies, as they can be used to develop specific antibodies or other targeted therapies to selectively kill cancer cells expressing these antigens.
