I have carefully reviewed the provided text and found no specific information regarding antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The text primarily focuses on the association between hyperglycemia and molecular subclasses in glioblastoma, without discussing antigens or their expression levels. Therefore, I cannot provide a list of antigens or any related details as requested.
