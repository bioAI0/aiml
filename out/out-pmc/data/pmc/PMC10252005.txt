I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Choline (Cho)
- Creatine (Cr)
- N-acetylaspartate (NAA)
- Myoinositol (mI)
- Glycine (Gly)
- Glutamate (Glx)
- Glutamine (Gln)
- Aliphatic amino acids (valine, leucine, isoleucine)
- Lipid + lactate

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, as they are used to differentiate between glioblastomas and other types of brain tumors. For example, the Cho/Cr ratio is used to distinguish between high-grade gliomas and brain metastases, and the combination of a high Cho/Cr ratio and the presence of lipid and lactate peaks in the non-enhancing peritumoral area (NEPA) allows the differential diagnosis of HGGs, BMs, and PCNSLs.

The paper also mentions that the Cho/Cr peak in the peritumoral area may be affected by steroids, as a reduction in the Cho/Cr peak was observed after the use of dexamethasone in low-grade gliomas, but the changes were not significant.

Additionally, the paper discusses the use of multiparametric MRI, including conventional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging methods, to provide a more accurate analysis of NEPAs in terms of therapy response to bevacizumab treatment for recurrence in HGG patients. The infiltrative tumoral area within the NEPAs is distinguished from vasogenic edema by means of PWI since high CBV, CBF, K-trans, and Vp values are associated with tumoral infiltration. Throughout the bevacizumab therapy, the increase in the tumor-infiltrative areas in the NEPAs occurs even in the absence of the growth of the enhancing tumor volume. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that anti-angiogenic therapy does not prevent the HGG infiltrative tumor progression, which can occur as an invasive, non-enhancing phenotype indistinguishable in conventional MRI from vasogenic edematous changes. However, the volumes of tumor-infiltrative edema at weeks 8 and 16 after the bevacizumab treatment initiation were correlated with the progression-free survival, suggesting a prognostic role for NEPAs in predicting the response to bevacizumab treatment.

The paper also mentions that the extent and MRI features of NEPAs were investigated to distinguish radionecrosis from progression in BM patients. The extent of NEPAs was proposed as a potential marker of radionecrosis in patients with BMs treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, as a high edema/lesion volume ratio was found to be predictive of radionecrosis as opposed to tumor recurrence. A biophysical model of NEPAs based on diffusion parameters, such as the cellular density marker, and tumoral growth from serial imaging time points, such as the proliferation rate index, was proposed to distinguish radionecrosis from tumor progression in BM patients.

The paper also discusses the use of advanced MRI techniques, such as PWI, DWI, and MRS, to distinguish infiltrative and non-infiltrative NEPAs. Infiltrative edema mainly demonstrates an increase in the perfusion parameters and Cho/Cr peak and a decrease in the NAA/Cr peak and ADC values. The accuracy of analyses increases when all these techniques are used in combination. Therefore, in the future, the radiomic evaluation of NEPAs based on multiple MRI parameters could be very useful in tumor assessment, along with large multicenter prospective studies including rigorous validation between centers and confirmation with histological data.
