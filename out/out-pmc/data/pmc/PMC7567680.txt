I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)

FAP is overexpressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of several cancer entities, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. The article mentions that FAP expression in healthy tissue is relatively low.

In the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, the article discusses the potential of directly targeting CAFs, which are made visible by FAPI-PET, with a radiation boost. This approach is suggested as a new perspective for treatment because it not only targets the cancer more accurately but also sensitizes the entire tumor to radiation, chemo-immunotherapy, and the body's own immune system.

The article also highlights the potential of FAPI imaging in early response evaluation during and after therapy. PET tracers can visualize biological and molecular changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by radiotherapy, enabling the adaptation of treatment plans and personalization of follow-up regimens.

However, the article does not provide specific information about the expression levels of FAP across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy. Further studies are required to evaluate the optimal threshold for FAP expression to specify precise tumor volume and reduce side effects of radiation therapy.
