The paper does not provide specific information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the EGFRvIII antigen in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. The EGFRvIII antigen is a mutated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is commonly found in glioblastoma and other cancers. The paper discusses a clinical trial (NCT02122822) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of a peptide vaccine called rindopepimut, which targets the EGFRvIII antigen. The trial showed a possible long-term survival benefit for GBM patients with significant residual disease who received rindopepimut compared to those with minimal residual disease. The authors suggest that residual disease is associated with greater antigen expression, leading to enhanced anti-tumor immunity required for a therapeutic effect.

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which involves engineering T cells to target specific antigens on cancer cells. While the paper does not provide details about the specific antigens targeted in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, it highlights the importance of residual tumor burdens in generating an effective immune response in immunotherapies such as CAR-T therapies.
