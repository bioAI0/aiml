I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen)

The paper mentions that PSMA is a transmembrane protein overexpressed in different tumour types, including gliomas. It also highlights the potential of PSMA-based tracers, which are already widely used in the theranostics of prostate cancer, to replicate their success in the adult-type diffuse glioma setting.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific role in immunotherapy or tumour targeting.
