- Nogo-A: Nogo-A is a myelin protein that is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is primarily responsible for inhibiting cell migration. It contains two inhibitory domains that bind to distinct cell surface receptors: the Nogo66 domain binds to the Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), and the Δ20 domain binds to the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Both receptors are strong activators of Ras homolog A (RhoA). The Δ20 domain of Nogo-A is a conserved disordered region that can adopt different conformations to interact with different binding partners. This flexibility enables Nogo-A to bind to both S1PR2 and SPARC, a matricellular protein that modulates the cellular microenvironment and is secreted by cells under stress conditions.
- SPARC: SPARC is a matricellular protein that is strongly expressed in highly invasive gliomas. It is secreted by glioblastoma cells in response to RhoA activation and is required for their ability to invade the white matter of the healthy brain. SPARC competes with S1PR2 for binding to an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the Nogo-A-Δ20 domain, acting as a decoy to attenuate the activation of inhibitory RhoA signaling via S1PR2. SPARC production is regulated by a novel RhoA-induced signaling mechanism that involves the deactivation of the ribonuclease IRE1α, which abolishes SPARC mRNA decay and allows glioma cells to secrete SPARC.
- S1PR2: S1PR2 is a receptor for Nogo-A that is expressed in established glioblastoma cell lines and in patient-derived low-passage glioblastoma cells. It is activated by the specific receptor agonist CYM-5520 and can be attenuated by the receptor antagonist JTE-013. S1PR2 is transactivated by the Δ20 domain of Nogo-A, mainly via its third extracellular loop, and is required for the induction of SPARC production in glioblastoma cells.
- NgR1: NgR1 is a receptor for Nogo-A that is not expressed by glioblastoma cells. Its expression is reduced in invasive glioma cell lines and human glioma tissues, with decreasing expression as malignancy increases.
- IRE1α: IRE1α is a kinase/endoribonuclease that regulates SPARC translation in a mechanism called regulated Ire1-dependent decay of messenger RNA (RIDD). It is deactivated by RhoA-induced signaling, which abolishes SPARC mRNA decay and allows glioma cells to secrete SPARC. The RNase activity of IRE1α is required for SPARC production, and its phosphorylation increases its RNase activity.
- ENTPD5: ENTPD5 is an ER-resident enzyme that enables a high protein folding capacity of the ER by sustaining UDP-glucose levels. It is transcriptionally upregulated by activated AKT signaling and is required for the production of SPARC in glioblastoma cells with high p-AKT1 levels. Inhibiting AKT1 phosphorylation or disturbing the enzymatic function of ENTPD5 prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production.
- PTEN: PTEN is a tumor suppressor protein that is often functionally inactivated in highly invasive gliomas. PTEN re-expression reduces p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels and prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production. However, not all PTEN-positive glioblastoma cells have low p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels, and WT PTEN expression in LNT229 glioblastoma cells is responsible for their low p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels.
- AKT1: AKT1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is constitutively active in highly invasive gliomas. It is often upregulated in gliomas due to genetic alterations of PI3K or PTEN. AKT1-driven ENTPD5 expression is required for glioblastoma cells to produce SPARC. Inhibiting AKT1 phosphorylation or re-expressing PTEN prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production.
