- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells
   - PD-L1
   - TIGIT
   - CD276
   - CD133
   - αvβ3 integrin
   - EGFR
   - EGFRvIII variant

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells are one of the least numerous immune cell populations in GBM, and are predominantly the CD56dimCD16− subtype.
   - PD-L1 expression is upregulated in glioma cells, and its expression is associated with poor prognosis.
   - TIGIT is expressed on tumor-infiltrating immune cells in GBM, and its expression is associated with immunosuppression.
   - CD276 is highly expressed in GBM cells, and its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.
   - CD133 is a marker of glioma stem cells, and its expression is associated with tumor initiation and progression.
   - αvβ3 integrin is highly expressed in GBM cells, and its expression is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis.
   - EGFR is overexpressed in GBM cells, and its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.
   - EGFRvIII variant is a mutated form of EGFR that is specifically expressed in GBM cells, and its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.

- **Mentions of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - CD3+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells are associated with prolonged survival in glioblastoma patients, despite integrated immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and at the systemic level.
   - PD-L1 is a target for immune checkpoint blockade, and its expression is associated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
   - TIGIT is a target for immune checkpoint blockade, and its expression is associated with immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.
   - CD276 is a target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, and its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.
   - CD133 is a target for CAR T-cell therapy, and its expression is associated with tumor initiation and progression.
   - αvβ3 integrin is a target for CAR T-cell therapy, and its expression is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis.
   - EGFR is a target for CAR T-cell therapy, and its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.
   - EGFRvIII variant is a target for CAR T-cell therapy, and its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.
