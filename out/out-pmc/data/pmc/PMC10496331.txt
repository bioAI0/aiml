- TSPO (Translocator protein)
- TSPO is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with prognostically unfavorable phenotypes.
- TSPO expression is linked to an enrichment of mesenchymal gene sets and higher amounts of tumor-associated macrophages.
- TSPO is a potential predictive biomarker for TAM-targeting immunotherapy.
- TSPO is a promising novel tracer target for positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain tumors.
- TSPO-PET imaging is a potential prognostic marker in patients suffering from diffuse gliomas.
- TSPO-PET imaging can mark the tumor microenvironment (TME) with its myeloid compartment and indicate therapy-induced changes during tumor progression.
- TSPO-PET imaging can be used to identify molecular subgroups and cellular composition, which is of great need to support improved precision immunotherapy treatment approaches.
- TSPO-PET imaging can support neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in case of high cell proportions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) or different options targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).
- TSPO is a transmembrane protein located in the outer mitochondrial barrier.
- TSPO has been associated with a broad spectrum of functions such as steroid synthesis, regulation of proliferation, apoptosis and migration, as well as mitochondrial functions such as mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress regulation.
- TSPO expression is regulated by a GC-rich promotor in breast cancer cell lines that contains binding sites for several transcription factors, including SP1 and SP3.
- Evidence exists that the PKCÎµ-ERK1/2-AP1-STAT3 signaling pathway can initiate TSPO transcription by upregulation of ETS and SP1/SP3 transcription factors (TFs) in MA-10 Leydig cells.
- TSPO transcriptional regulation in gliomas is still poorly understood.
- TSPO is normally expressed at very low levels in the central nervous system (CNS) compared to other healthy tissues.
- TSPO expression is upregulated at sites of inflammation or neurodegeneration and also in gliomas.
- TSPO-PET imaging is a potential prognostic marker in patients suffering from diffuse gliomas.
- TSPO-PET imaging has been described to mark the tumor microenvironment (TME) with its myeloid compartment and to indicate therapy-induced changes during tumor progression.
- Regarding the cellular source of TSPO-PET, tumor cells, reactive astrocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages/ microglia have been discussed.
- TSPO-PET imaging can be used to identify molecular subgroups and cellular composition, which is of great need to support improved precision immunotherapy treatment approaches.
