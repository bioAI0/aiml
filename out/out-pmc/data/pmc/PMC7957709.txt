- SOCS3: SOCS3 is a protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and is associated with chemo- and radioresistance in glioblastoma. The study found that elevated SOCS3 expression is positively correlated with increased neovascularization in glioblastoma samples.
- VEGFA: VEGFA is an angiogenic cytokine that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and is associated with GBM prognosis. The study found that VEGFA expression levels are correlated with SOCS3 expression levels, and that the three-gene transcriptome signature of SOCS3, VEGFA, and TEK can be used to predict the prognosis of all GBM subclasses.
- TEK: TEK is a receptor that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and is associated with GBM prognosis. The study found that TEK expression levels are correlated with SOCS3 and VEGFA expression levels, and that the three-gene transcriptome signature of SOCS3, VEGFA, and TEK can be used to predict the prognosis of all GBM subclasses.

The study also mentions that these antigens are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and are associated with GBM prognosis. However, there is no specific information provided about their expression levels across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
