- **EGFR:** EGFR signaling is known to activate the oncogenic PI3K-AKT–mTOR and RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathways. Exposure to EGF leads to proliferation of Olig2+ type C cells, and inhibition of EGFR signaling results in Olig2 depletion, indicating that EGFR signaling is responsible for sustaining Olig2 expression in progenitor cells. EGFR signaling activates Olig2, and Olig2 directly targets EGFR. Overexpression of Olig2 leads to significant upregulation of EGFR and transcripts. Phosphorylated Olig2 leads to differentially regulated genes associated with RTKs.
