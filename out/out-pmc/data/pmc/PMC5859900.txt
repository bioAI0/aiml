- TERT (Telomerase reverse transcriptase): TERT is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) and is associated with increased TERT transcripts and upregulation of TERT mRNA. TERT promoter mutations are selectively observed in IDH-wildtype GBM, and the presence of these mutations is well-correlated with distinctive glioma groups. The study suggests that TERT could be a good therapeutic target against IDH-wildtype GBM, and a specific TERT-targeting therapy might be a promising strategy.
- ATRX (Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked gene): ATRX is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype GBM, as it is associated with telomere length and TERT upregulation. The study suggests that ATRX loss could be a contributing factor in upregulating TERT protein expression.
- IDH1/2 (Isocitrate dehydrogenase genes 1 and 2): IDH1/2 mutations are mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype GBM, as they are associated with the classification of diffuse gliomas. The study suggests that IDH-wildtype GBM has a dismal prognosis and could benefit from specific TERT-targeting therapy.
- p53: p53 is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype GBM, as it is associated with the classification of diffuse gliomas. The study suggests that p53 could be a potential biomarker for the applicability of TERT-targeting therapeutics.
