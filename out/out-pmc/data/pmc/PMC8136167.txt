- MARCO: MARCO is a scavenger receptor normally found on alveolar macrophages with a variety of immunomodulatory roles. It is highly expressed on a subpopulation of macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but not in IDH-mutant GBM or lower-grade gliomas. MARCO expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes and the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. The mesenchymal nature of MARCO is supported by its role in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition outside the context of cancer. MARCO+ macrophages demonstrate loss of inflammatory pathways and antigen presentation, and are recruited from the blood via the upregulation of a set of factors secreted by tumor cells, including CSF1 and TGF-β. Anti-MARCO therapeutic antibodies have demonstrated efficacy in mouse melanoma models, and MARCO expression changes in the course of anti-PD1 immunotherapy, with responders exhibiting decreases in MARCO in the long term following treatment.
- CSF1: CSF1 is a macrophage colony-stimulating factor that is upregulated in tumor cells and is associated with higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. CSF1 expression in tumor cells has been previously shown to be related to higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. CSF1R inhibitors are a potential therapeutic option for targeting TAMs.
- TGF-β: TGF-β is a growth factor that is upregulated in tumor cells and is associated with higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. TGF-β has been experimentally shown to upregulate MARCO expression in M0 BMDMs, joining a host of other studies implicating TGF-β in glioma progression.

These antigens are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells and are associated with poor clinical outcomes and the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. They are also involved in the recruitment of macrophages from the blood and have been targeted in immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies.
