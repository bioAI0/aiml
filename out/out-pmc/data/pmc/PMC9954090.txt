- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and is involved in ECM remodeling and fibrogenesis. FAP is expressed at low to non-detectable levels in normal organs but is greatly upregulated at sites of tissue remodeling and tumor stroma.

- FAP is involved in various pathological processes and can be detected in more than 90% of malignant epithelial tumors. Targeting FAP is a promising approach for molecular imaging technologies, including positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), as FAP inhibitors exhibit rapid and almost complete internalization upon administration and rapid clearance from the circulation.

- FAP expression is associated with worse prognosis in colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and hepatocellular cancer. The first clinical application of FAP-based imaging involving the use of antibodies and boronic acid-based inhibitor molecules demonstrated limited clinical value due to the low blood clearance rate and limitations associated with gamma imaging.

- More recently, quinoline-based FAPIs have been developed as radiopharmaceuticals for PET/CT imaging. As a novel PET/CT tracer, FAPIs were compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in tumor detection rate and clinical efficiency, showing a higher sensitivity in identifying primary tumors and metastases involving lymph node, bone, and viscera.

- The novel imaging agent FAPI is currently applied during clinical practice to diagnose and manage several malignant tumors and their associated metastases. In this respect, Jiang et al. and Kuten et al. have observed a higher tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) in FAPI than in FDG, with little variations and fluctuations in the SUVmax in ovarian cancers and colorectal cancers.

- In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, FAP recognition and inhibition via 4-1 BB bispecific agonists have been proposed as a potential strategy for tumor-targeted therapy.
