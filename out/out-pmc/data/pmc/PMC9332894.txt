- PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha): PDGFRA is the second most frequently mutated tyrosine kinase receptor in glioblastoma (GBM), and its amplification is associated with oligodendroglial morphology and malignancy. The study found that PDGFRA gain/amplification is a significant predictor of poor prognosis in patients with IDH wild-type GBM.
- MGMTp (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter): MGMTp methylation is a well-established favorable prognostic marker for survival and predicts the response to temozolomide in patients with GBM. The study showed that unmethylated MGMTp is a significant predictor of poor prognosis in IDH wild-type GBM.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
