I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein
- FGFR3
- TACC3
- OLIG2
- GFAP
- OLIG2
- GFAP
- CDK4
- MDM2

These antigens are specifically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are not mentioned in the context of other cancer types in this paper. The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is a recurrent oncogenic fusion protein found in about 3% of squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial carcinoma, 3.9% of cervical cancer patients, and 4% of glioblastoma patients. The FGFR3 gene and the TACC3 gene are located on chromosome 4p16.3, only 48kb apart from each other within a region that is associated with translocation-causing breakpoints in multiple myeloma. This spatial proximity and the localization at a double-strand hotspot is one theory explaining why this fusion protein is found so frequently. An alternative explanation of the frequent recurrence of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion is that the fusion protein leads to specific survival benefits, such as proliferation gain and increased cell survival. Cells that express the fusion protein might thereby prevail in a setting of selection pressure.

The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is involved in several cellular processes and signaling cascades, leading to FGFR3-TACC3 overexpression, increased kinase activity, and corresponding downstream signaling, morphological changes, increased cell growth, altered cellular metabolism, stress response, and even dysregulated mitotic progression, resulting in aneuploidy. The kinase activity of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein plays a crucial role in the proliferation and survival of glioblastoma cells. The ability to dimerize TACC3 leads to the presence of a constitutively dimerized, and thereby activated, FGFR3 tyrosine kinase domain in fusion-positive tumor cells and hyperactivated downstream signaling, resulting in an overexpression of phosphorylated FRS2, the initial intracellular binding partner of FGFR3, to activate ERK1/2 and AKT signaling. Parker et al. detected an increased activation of pERK, but not of STAT3 and pAKT, in fusion-positive cells while other authors saw enhanced STAT3 and STAT1 activation. Nelson et al. showed that only plasma membrane localized FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein leads to formation of oncogenic foci in fusion transfected NIH3T3 cells. This goes along with increased MAPK signaling activation, while cytoplasmatic localized FGFR3-TACC3 does not induce oncogenic transformation, supporting the hypothesis that the oncogenic force of the fusion protein is dependent on its kinase activity. The phosphorylation site Y746 is of major importance for activation of ERK, STAT and PI3K signaling. Y746 is hyperphosphorylated in FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive cells and MAPK activation is increased in fusion-positive cells. Treatment with the kinase inhibitors BGJ398 and trametinib resulted in reduction in MAPK signaling and had an antitumor effect in FGFR3-TACCex11 and FGFR3-TACC3ex8 transfected cells, but the signaling and treatment response differed between the two isoforms.

TACC3 in its wildtype form is phosphorylated by Aurora-A and forms a complex with clathrin and ch-TOG, which is localized to the mitotic spindle apparatus and provides its stability. When fused to the FGFR3-protein, TACC3 lacks a phosphorylation site for Aurora-A. Confocal imaging of FGFR3-TACC3 showed an arc-shaped structure of the protein, bending over and enchasing the metaphase spindle poles, but not relocating to the mid body, leading to erratic mitotic segregation. FGFR3-TACC3-positive cells exhibit a 3 to 5-fold higher number of errors in chromosomal segregation and resulting aneuploidy, an effect, that could be reduced to 80% by treatment with the kinase inhibitor PD173074. This, however, implies that the activity of FGFR3-TACC3 in aneuploidy induction is dependent on its kinase activity.

Gene ontology mapping of the dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed enriched expression of genes that are related to oxidative phosphorylation, high mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Additionally, increased mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial mass, and higher levels of ATP were detected in FGFR3-TACC3 transfected astrocytes compared to control cells, and the fusion-positive cells showed an elevated basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate, as well as a mild increase in the extracellular acidification rate. Gene expression levels of the respiratory complex proteins SDHB, UQCRC1, ATP5A1, and the mitochondrial membrane transporter VDAC1 were elevated in fusion-positive cells. Anti-pY immunoprecipitation showed that only FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive cells contained phosphorylated PIN4, an activator of mitochondrial metabolism and anabolic response, leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species and thereby, elevated expression of the transcription regulators PGC1α and ERRγ, which increase mitochondrial metabolism. Accordingly, the FGFR3-TACC3-positive cells were sensitive towards treatment with mitochondrial inhibitors such as menadione, metformin, and tigecycline in vitro.

Besides this, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion leads to morphological changes characterized by the rounding up of the cells in HEK293T cells, the activation of cell signaling pathways related to chaperone activation, the stress response and regulation of tp53 expression, and the degradation and resistance to EGFR inhibitors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma cells.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies regarding treatment with FGFR-inhibitors for FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive gliomas have led to promising results. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZD4547, PD173074, BGJ398, and JNJ-42756493 inhibited the proliferation of FGFR3-TACC3 transfected astrocytes in vitro and led to reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in glioma-bearing mice. PD173074 was even more able to suppress the kinase phosphorylation of FGFR3 and reduced aneuploidy by about 80%. In FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioma cell lines, the FGFR-inhibitors PD173074 and AZD4547 had an antiproliferative effect, and the kinase inhibitor pazopanib caused cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, a higher sensitivity of fusion-positive glioma cells towards the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 was observed.

In other cancer cell lines, such as cholangiocarcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma, a higher potency of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has also been described. Parker-Kerrigan et al. transfected 10 unique siRNAs into glioblastoma and bladder cancer cell lines, which led to the depletion of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein, while wildtype FGFR3 was not affected. The siRNA knockdown of FGFR3-TACC3 in glioblastoma cells leads to reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

A small number of case reports regarding the use of kinase inhibitors in patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioblastomas exists: Wang et al. treated two patients with the kinase inhibitor anlotinib. A 65-year-old woman with a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive glioblastoma, diagnosed in 01/2020, received anlotinib after she had tumor progress following gross total resection and treatment with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide and five adjuvant cycles of temozolomide. She had partial response after three months of treatment with anlotinib and was still alive at the time of publication. The second patient, a 44-year-old woman, was diagnosed with FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma in 12/2017. She was treated with radiochemotherapy, according to the STUPP-regimen, and afterwards received treatment with nedaplatin and bevacizumab. In 06/2018, she had tumor progress and started treatment with a temozolomide rescue scheme and anlotinib. After two months, she had partial response and was also still alive when the authors published the article.

The kinase inhibitor JNJ-42756493 was also administered to two glioblastoma patients, a 52-year-old man and a 64-year-old woman, who were both diagnosed with FGFR3-TACC3-positive glioblastoma. Both patients underwent gross total resection of the tumor, followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. After they experienced tumor progress, both received JNJ-42756493. The first patient reached stable disease for 115 days before he exhibited new tumor progression, while the second patient had partial response after 4 weeks and was on treatment for 134 days before she exhibited progressive disease. The pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib (JNJ-42756493) was administered to 65 patients with solid tumors in a phase 1 trial. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were detected in one glioblastoma patient, two urothelial carcinoma patients, and one patient with adrenal carcinoma who showed partial response under treatment with erdafitinib.

Currently, there are diverse ongoing trials regarding the use of tyrosine kinase receptors in FGFR3-TACC3 positive glioblastomas. The FGFR1-3 receptor inhibitors AZ4547 and BGJ398 were both evaluated for patients with FGFR1-TACC1 and FGFR3-TACC3 fused glioblastomas; however, the results have not yet been published. A study considering infigratinib (BGJ398) for patients with unselected FGFR-altered glioblastoma proved the safety of the drug, despite only limited effects. Nevertheless, response with a stable disease for over one year was observed in a patient with a FGFR3-TACC3-fused glioblastoma.

The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is a promising target for personalized diagnostics and specific therapy in glioblastoma. Its specific functional and clinical relevance should justify further effort to answer open questions and establish the markers in daily clinical practice.
