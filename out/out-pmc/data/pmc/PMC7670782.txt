- LBH (Limb-bud and Heart)
- SCARA3 (Scavenger Receptor Class A Member 3)

These antigens were found to be highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as indicated by the study's results. LBH is directly regulated by HIF-1 and promotes angiogenesis in human brain microvessel endothelial cells through the VEGFA-mediated ERK signaling pathway under hypoxic conditions. SCARA3 mRNA is overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma compared with breast carcinoma effusions, and it promotes drug resistance in multiple myeloma.

The study also mentions that these antigens have been reported in previous research, suggesting their potential as targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies. However, it does not provide specific information on their expression levels across different cancer types or their direct involvement in immunotherapy.
