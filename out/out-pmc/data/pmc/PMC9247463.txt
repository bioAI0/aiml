- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9)
   - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α)
   - Nestin
   - Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1)

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - CA9: Widely expressed in perinecrotic tumor cells, particularly in recurrent glioblastomas.
   - HIF-1α: Expressed in tumor cells around sites of necrosis and also found in tumor cells not directly adjacent to necrotic areas.
   - Nestin: Expressed in many glioblastomas, with downregulation associated with differentiation.
   - FOXM1: Overexpressed in glioblastomas and upregulated in recurrent glioblastomas at both mRNA and protein levels.

- **Immunotherapy and tumor targeting:**
   - The study investigates the potential of FOXM1 as a biomarker for survival during anti-VEGF therapy, suggesting that it may be a marker for proliferating glioma stem cells (GSCs) and a prediction biomarker for survival.
   - The authors also discuss the role of vascular co-option as a mechanism of resistance to antiangiogenic treatment, which may be exploited by recurrent glioblastomas to escape anti-VEGF therapy.
   - The study highlights the importance of understanding the TME and its impact on tumor dormancy, as well as the potential of combining Bevacizumab with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes.
