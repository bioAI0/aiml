- B7-H3 (CD276): This antigen is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 14.07 (1.02) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 12.35 (0.87) in unmethylated cases. B7-H3 is a costimulatory molecule for T cell activation and IFN-Î³ production, and its expression is associated with lower overall survival in high-grade glioma.
- PD-L1: PD-L1 expression is significantly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 11.50 (0.57) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 10.62 (0.58) in unmethylated cases. PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 on T-cells, potentially suppressing T-cell activation. Its expression is also associated with increased PD-L1 inhibitor (nivolumab) use in clinical practice.
- CD4: CD4 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 11.22 (0.65) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 9.58 (1.01) in unmethylated cases. CD4 is a T-helper cell marker, and its increased expression may indicate higher levels of T-helper cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD14: CD14 expression is significantly elevated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 12.58 (1.61) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 9.47 (1.46) in unmethylated cases. CD14 is a marker for monocytes and macrophages, and its increased expression may suggest a higher presence of these immune cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD68: CD68 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 12.97 (1.00) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 11.14 (0.80) in unmethylated cases. CD68 is a marker for macrophages and microglia, and its increased expression may indicate a higher presence of these cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD8A: CD8A expression is significantly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 8.30 (0.78) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 6.90 (0.66) in unmethylated cases. CD8A is a cytotoxic T-cell marker, and its increased expression may suggest a higher presence of cytotoxic T-cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD19: CD19 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 7.77 (0.74) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 6.66 (0.63) in unmethylated cases. CD19 is a B-cell marker, and its increased expression may indicate a higher presence of B-lymphocytes in the tumour microenvironment.
- FOXP3: FOXP3 expression is significantly elevated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 7.94 (0.73) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 7.02 (0.51) in unmethylated cases. FOXP3 is a unique transcriptional repressor protein expressed by T-regulatory cells, and its increased expression may suggest a higher presence of T-regulatory cells in the tumour microenvironment.
- CD44: CD44 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 15.58 (1.24) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 13.30 (1.60) in unmethylated cases. CD44 is a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, and migration. Its increased expression may be associated with tumour progression and metastasis.
- STAT3: STAT3 expression is significantly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 12.85 (1.44) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 13.24 (0.87) in unmethylated cases. STAT3 is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Its increased expression may be associated with tumour progression and resistance to therapy.
