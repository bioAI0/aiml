I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on temporal muscle thickness (TMT) as a potential prognostic marker in glioblastoma, but it does not discuss antigens or their expression levels in different cancer types. Additionally, there is no mention of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of these antigens.
