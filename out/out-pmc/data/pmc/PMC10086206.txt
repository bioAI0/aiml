I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- HLA-G: Expressed on the surface of glioma cells, HLA-G can bind to CD8A on T cells, inducing a Fas-FasL mediated apoptosis of CD8+ T cells.
- CD70: Expressed on the surface of glioma cells, CD70 interacts with its corresponding receptor to cause T cell dysfunction and enable immune evasion.
- HLA-E: Expressed on the surface of glioma cells, HLA-E interacts with its corresponding receptor to cause T cell dysfunction and enable immune evasion.
- HVEM: Expressed on the surface of glioma cells, HVEM interacts with its corresponding receptor to cause T cell dysfunction and enable immune evasion.
- FALSG: Expressed on the surface of glioma cells, FALSG interacts with its corresponding receptor to cause T cell dysfunction and enable immune evasion.
- LGALS1: Expressed on the surface of glioma cells, LGALS1 interacts with its corresponding receptor to cause T cell dysfunction and enable immune evasion.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The paper discusses how the interactions of these antigens with their corresponding receptors can lead to T cell dysfunction and enable immune evasion in glioma cells. Additionally, the paper highlights the potential of targeting these antigens for immunotherapy, as blocking their interactions can enhance T cell-mediated killing of glioma cells.
