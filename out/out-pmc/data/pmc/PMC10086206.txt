- **HLA-G**: HLA-G is an immune checkpoint molecule that is highly expressed on glioblastoma cells, particularly in the IDH-wildtype subtype. It has been shown to interact with CD8A on T cells, leading to their apoptosis and contributing to immune evasion. HLA-G is also expressed on other cancer types, such as melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma, and its expression is associated with response to immunotherapy.
- **CD70**: CD70 is a ligand expressed on the surface of glioblastoma cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, that interacts with its receptor on T cells, leading to their dysfunction and immune evasion.
- **HLA-E**: HLA-E is another MHC class I molecule that is expressed on glioblastoma cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and interacts with its receptor on T cells, contributing to immune evasion.
- **HVEM**: HVEM is a ligand expressed on the surface of glioblastoma cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, that binds to its receptor on T cells, leading to their dysfunction and immune evasion.
- **FALSG**: FALSG is a ligand expressed on the surface of glioblastoma cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, that interacts with its receptor on T cells, contributing to immune evasion.
- **LGALS1**: LGALS1 is a ligand expressed on the surface of glioblastoma cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, that binds to its receptor on T cells, leading to their dysfunction and immune evasion.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of glioblastoma immune evasion and immunotherapy, with HLA-G and CD70 being highlighted as potential targets for immunotherapeutic approaches.
