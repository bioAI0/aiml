The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
- CDKN2A/B
- SOX-2
- Nestin

The MGMT promoter methylation is a molecular marker used in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, specifically for prognostication and clinical decision-making. The MGMT promoter methylation is present in approximately 80% of WHO grade 2 and 35–45% of WHO grade 3 and 4 gliomas. The MGMT gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed repair enzyme that removes alkyl groups from guanine in the DNA. If the MGMT enzyme is active, it can remove the O-6′ methyl groups introduced by TMZ-chemotherapy, partly repairing the DNA and reducing its therapeutic impact. The downregulation of its expression by the methylation of its promoter is thought to increase TMZ efficiency.

The IDH mutation is a molecular profile that distinguishes IDH-mutant astrocytomas from IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Tumors with a mutation of IDH have a molecular profile and thus an origin distinct from IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. This is supported by evidence that tumors previously diagnosed as IDH-wildtype astrocytomas corresponding to WHO (2016) grades II or III actually represent IDHwt glioblastoma and are now classified as such, while former IDH-mutant glioblastomas have been renamed into IDH-mutant astrocytomas (CNS WHO grade 4) to reflect a distinct lineage. These tumors are defined by having morphological high-grade features (necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation) and/or the presence of CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion.

The SOX-2 and Nestin antigens are mentioned in the context of immunofluorescence staining to identify stem-like glioma-initiating cells. These cells are believed to play a major role in tumor initiation and recurrence and are thought to be particularly resilient. The strong co-expression of SOX-2 and Nestin in all specimens before and after treatment, regardless of treatment group and cell line, indicates that the stem-like cell characteristics of all three cell lines were not altered by the treatment.

The CDKN2A/B antigen is mentioned in the context of the 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumors, which defines IDH-mutant astrocytomas (CNS WHO grade 4) as having morphological high-grade features (necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation) and/or the presence of CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific roles in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
