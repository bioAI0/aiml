I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on the role of PROX1 as a prognostic factor for patients with high-grade astrocytomas, but it does not provide details about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells.
