- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
  - MAGE-1
  - AIM-2
  - HER2/neu
  - TRP-2
  - gp100
  - IL-13Rα2

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
  - MAGE-1: Expressed in neuroblastoma cells and can be upregulated to facilitate cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated tumor cell killing.
  - AIM-2: Expressed in human glioma cells.
  - HER2/neu: Expressed in glioblastoma cells.
  - TRP-2: Expressed in human glioma cells.
  - gp100: Expressed in glioblastoma cells.
  - IL-13Rα2: Expressed in glioblastoma cells and recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

- **Mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
  - MAGE-1, AIM-2, HER2/neu, TRP-2, gp100, and IL-13Rα2 are all expressed on both tumor and cancer stem cells, making them potential targets for immunotherapy.
  - The ICT-107 vaccine targets these antigens and has shown some success in clinical trials, although it did not meet the primary endpoint of improved overall survival.
  - The study by Bockmayr et al. demonstrated a positive correlation between infiltrating T cells, defined by a gene signature consisting of 10 mRNA expression levels, and overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
  - The study by Ladomerski et al. showed that depletion of CD8+ T cells at a late time-point during tumorigenesis and treatment in a syngeneic murine glioma model leads to a loss of treatment effect, while CD4+ T cells were indispensable at every time-point.
  - The study by Bockmayr et al. demonstrated a positive correlation of infiltrating T cells, defined by a gene signature consisting of 10 mRNA expression levels, with overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
