- Fibroblast activation protein α (FAP): FAP is a trans-membrane cell surface protein with serine peptidase activity, which is selectively expressed in activated or cancer-educated fibroblasts. It is one of the most commonly used and reliable CAF markers due to its selective expression in activated or cancer-educated fibroblasts, and functions to suppress anti-tumor immune cells, promote tumor growth, and drive epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Clinically, the abundance of FAP+ CAFs is associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer. FAP is considered a promising therapeutic target for cancer therapy, and strategies to target FAP+ CAFs include small molecule FAP inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and other immunotherapies.

- α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA): αSMA is a marker commonly used for CAFs, vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes. It is linked to a myofibroblast phenotype.

- Fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP1): FSP1 is a CAF marker that exhibits strong expression within the myeloid population in GBM.

- Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) α and β: PDGFRs are markers used to identify CAFs. PDGFRβ is a well-documented brain pericyte marker and is co-expressed with FAP in GBM-associated pericytes.

- Nestin: Nestin is a marker for primarily labeling GBM or stem/progenitor cells.

- IDH1 R132H: IDH1 R132H is a marker for neoplastic cells in IDH-mutant GBM.

- TGF-β1: TGF-β1 is a cytokine that is secreted by FAP+ cells in GBM and contributes to immunosuppression. It is also associated with the maintenance of GBM stem cells.

- Olig2: Olig2 is a marker for glioma/oligodendrocyte cells.

- GFAP: GFAP is an astrocyte marker.

- Ki67: Ki67 is a tumor proliferation marker.

- Arg1: Arg1 is a marker for M2 macrophages.

- CD13 (ANPEP) and CD248: CD13 and CD248 are additional pericyte markers that show elevated mRNA levels in the vascular cell populations of GBM.

- S100A4 (FSP1): FSP1 is a CAF marker that exhibits strong expression within the myeloid population in GBM.

- E2F transcription factors: E2F transcription factors are activated in cancer cells and are targeted by oncolytic adenoviruses.

- IL-10: IL-10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine secreted by GBM-associated pericytes.

- CD10 and GPR77: CD10 and GPR77 are markers for cancer-associated fibroblasts that promote cancer formation and chemoresistance.

- HSF1: HSF1 is a transcription factor that is upregulated in the tumor stroma and contributes to malignancy.

- RB-E2F: RB-E2F is a pathway that is targeted by oncolytic adenoviruses for selective killing of cancer cells.

- MHC class I: MHC class I is a molecule that is upregulated by oncolytic herpes simplex virus to enhance antigen presentation and tumor cell killing.

- Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP): PARP is a protein that is targeted by oncolytic viruses in combination with PARP inhibitors for enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

- LIF: LIF is a cytokine that is upregulated by TGF-β in glioma-initiating cells and contributes to self-renewal.

- Sry-related HMG-box factors: Sry-related HMG-box factors are transcription factors that are activated by TGF-β in glioma-initiating cells and contribute to tumorigenicity.

- Delta-24-E1A: Delta-24-E1A is a modified E1A promoter in oncolytic adenoviruses that enhances potency, selectivity, and transgene-arming capacity.

- RGD-fiber: RGD-fiber is a modification in oncolytic adenoviruses that enhances tumor cell killing.

- Δ24-E1A: Δ24-E1A is a modification in oncolytic adenoviruses that enhances tumor cell killing.
