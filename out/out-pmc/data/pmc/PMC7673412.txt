- EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)
- P53
- Ki-67

The paper discusses the expression of these antigens in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with the following key points:

- EGFR expression was positive in 84.6% of the cohort, with no significant difference between local and non-local progression groups.
- P53 expression was positive in 68.2% of the cohort, with no significant difference between long-term and short-term survivors in the non-local progression group.
- Ki-67 index was high in 36.6% of the cohort, with no significant difference between local and non-local progression groups.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
