- **FGFR3-TACC3 fusion**: This fusion is found in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with characteristic histopathological and molecular features. It is a potential target for targeted therapy, with anlotinib showing promising results in a case report.
- **PDK1**: PDK1 is a hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1 regulated gene that may promote EGFR activation, sustaining malignant progression. Inhibiting PDK1 can greatly inhibit glioma cell colony and sphere formation and sensitize glioma spheres to temozolomide toxicity.
- **CD2**: CD2 is a transmembrane molecule expressed on T, natural killer (NK), and dendritic cells, essential for immunology. It is involved in tumor invasion and is highly expressed in breast cancer.
- **COL5A1**: COL5A1 is related to the occurrence and progression of multiple types of malignant tumors, including breast cancer and gliomas. It is positively correlated with the increasing malignancy of glioblastoma through the PPRC1-ESM1 axis activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and it may be a potential therapeutic target for glioma.
- **PBK**: PBK expression is associated with cell growth and apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and immune responses, playing an essential role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. It is found to be upregulated in GBM patients, and its inhibition can almost completely abolish tumor growth, making it a potentially promising therapeutic target for GBM treatment.
- **FANCA**: FANCA is associated with tissue proliferation and is found to be overexpressed in many types of cancers. Targeting the FA pathway may provide a novel strategy for the sensitization of solid tumors and investigation of chemoresistance in different tumor types.
- **ANXA7**: ANXA7 is a ubiquitinated tumor suppressor gene. Loss of ANXA7 function stabilizes the EGFR protein, augments EGFR transforming signaling in glioblastoma cells, and promotes tumorigenesis.
- **TACC3**: TACC3 is often mentioned with FGFR3-TACC3 fusion, an oncogenic driver. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions generate powerful oncogenes that combine growth-promoting effects with aneuploidy through the activation of as yet unclear intracellular signaling mechanisms. FGFR inhibition has shown encouraging outcomes in mouse studies, and targeting FGFR3-TACC3 fusion is evaluated by many ongoing early-phase human clinical trials.
