- EGFR: EGFR amplification is a common feature of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is associated with a worse prognosis. EGFR is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies in glioblastoma, and its expression levels can vary across different cancer types.
- PTEN: PTEN deletion is associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and its loss can lead to increased tumor growth and progression.
- CDKN2A: CDKN2A homozygous deletion is a strong adverse prognostic factor in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CDKN2A is a cell cycle regulator, and its loss can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.
- TERT: TERT promoter mutation is a common feature of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is associated with a worse prognosis. TERT is a telomerase gene, and its mutation can lead to increased telomerase activity and cell immortality.
- MGMT: MGMT promoter methylation is an important predictive marker in terms of response to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, specifically in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. MGMT is a DNA-repair protein, and its expression levels inversely correlate with promoter methylation.
- CDK4/MDM2: CDK4 and MDM2 co-amplification is associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CDK4 and MDM2 are cell cycle regulators, and their co-amplification can lead to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth.
- PIK3CA: PIK3CA mutations are associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. PIK3CA is a kinase involved in cell growth and survival signaling pathways.
- BRAF (V600E): BRAF V600E mutation is associated with a better prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. BRAF is a kinase involved in cell growth and survival signaling pathways, and its mutation can lead to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth.
- Chromosomes 19 and 20: Co-gain of chromosomes 19 and 20 is associated with a better prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Chromosome 19 and 20 gains can lead to increased expression of tumor suppressor genes and decreased tumor growth.
