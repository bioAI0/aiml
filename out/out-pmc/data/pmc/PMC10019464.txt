- Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression is downregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, which restricts antigen presentation and contributes to immune escape.
- Fas-ligand expression is increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, facilitating cell death in leukocytes.
- Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are immunosuppressive cytokines secreted by IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, suppressing immune response.
- The signaling pathway of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) tends to have mutations that occur more often in the IDH-wildtype glioblastoma of biological female patients.
- The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has genetic changes that occur more frequently in the helical domain for females and the kinase domain for males in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, demonstrating a sex preference for mutation location.
