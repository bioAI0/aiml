- Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP)
- FAP is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and is associated with mesenchymal features.
- FAP is a potential target for imaging and treatment of malignant tumors, including glioblastomas.
- Approaches utilizing FAP expression for tumor imaging and targeted delivery of anticancer therapeutics have been described.
- TGFbeta-1-induced expression of FAP opens the possibility of evaluating these approaches for parallel therapeutic targeting of several cell subpopulations in glioblastoma.
