I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- IDH1 wildtype
- pMGMT
- IDH2

These antigens are not mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text. However, the paper does discuss the potential significance of these molecular markers in determining the prognosis of glioblastoma patients.

The paper highlights that the presence of IDH1 wildtype and pMGMT methylation status did not show a significant difference between cystic and non-cystic glioblastomas. This suggests that the improved survival observed in cystic glioblastomas is not solely due to these molecular markers.

Additionally, the paper mentions that none of the studies included in the review compared the presence of 1p/19q co-deletion or IDH2 mutation status. Zhou et al. suggested that the association of cystic glioblastoma with telomere length and pMGMT methylation should be further analyzed.

It is important to note that the overall quality of the evidence in this study was low, and the authors recommend future prospective studies with better control for bias to investigate the survival outcomes of cystic versus non-cystic glioblastoma.
