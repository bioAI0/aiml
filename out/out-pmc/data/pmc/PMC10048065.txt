I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- IDH1 G105G SNP: This SNP was found to have no prognostic impact on IDH wild-type glioblastoma.
- 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor 2A (HTR2A): HTR2A is associated with glioma grade through neuroactive ligand receptor interaction.
- Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1): GRM1 may contribute to glioma development through the calcium signaling pathway.
- Adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2): ADCY2 may also contribute to glioma development through the calcium signaling pathway.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and their expression levels across different cancer types are not provided in the text. However, the study does discuss the potential of these antigens as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as their role in the tumor microenvironment and immune cell infiltration.

The text also mentions immunotherapy in the context of glioma, but does not specifically mention these antigens in relation to immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
