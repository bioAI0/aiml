- EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor): EGFR is thought to be a key oncogenic driver in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with amplification observed in 35-45% of cases. The article discusses various EGFR-targeted therapies for glioblastoma, including anti-EGFR antibody-loaded nanoparticles, anti-EGFRvIII CAR-T therapy, antibody drug conjugates like depatuxizumab mafodotin, and clinical trials investigating monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors against EGFR.

- CDKN2A: CDKN2A loss is common in 35-60% of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and is independently associated with worse overall and progression-free survival. The article mentions that CDKN2A loss has been detected in 14 out of 18 gliosarcoma specimens in a microarray study, suggesting further investigation into its implications for prognosis.

- CDKN2B: The article reports that CDKN2B is altered in 28% of gliosarcoma samples, specifically representing copy number losses. However, it does not provide information on its expression levels across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- RB1: RB1 is altered in 26% of gliosarcoma samples, with both mutations and copy number alterations. The article does not provide further details on its expression levels in different cancer types or its potential as a target for immunotherapy.

- STAG2: STAG2 is altered in 17% of gliosarcoma samples. The article does not offer additional information on its expression across cancer types or its relevance to immunotherapy.

- MSH6: MSH6 is altered in 11% of gliosarcoma samples. The article does not provide details on its expression levels in various cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- SUZ12: SUZ12 is altered in 11% of gliosarcoma samples. The article does not offer additional information on its expression across cancer types or its potential as a target for immunotherapy.

- SOX2: SOX2 is altered in 11% of gliosarcoma samples, specifically through amplification. The article does not provide further details on its expression levels in different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- CREBBP: CREBBP is altered in 11% of gliosarcoma samples, with both mutations and copy number alterations. The article does not provide additional information on its expression levels across cancer types or its potential as a target for immunotherapy.

- PTPN11: PTPN11 is altered in 10% of gliosarcoma samples. The article does not offer further details on its expression levels in different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- FBXW7: FBXW7 is altered in 7% of gliosarcoma samples. The article does not provide additional information on its expression across cancer types or its potential as a target for immunotherapy.

- APC: APC is altered in 7% of gliosarcoma samples. The article does not offer further details on its expression levels in different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
