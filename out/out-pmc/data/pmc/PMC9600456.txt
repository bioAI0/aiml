I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
- Angiogenesis genes
- 2-HG

**VEGF:**
VEGF is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype gliomas, which are described as having higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. This is contrary to previous reports, suggesting that the relationship between VEGF expression and IDH status is complex and may vary depending on other factors.

**Angiogenesis genes:**
Angiogenesis genes are upregulated in contrast enhancement regions of IDH-wildtype gliomas, leading to increased contrast. This finding highlights the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of these tumors and their potential as therapeutic targets.

**2-HG:**
2-HG is a signature metabolite produced by IDH mutations, and its increase is associated with tumor cell proliferation. The article discusses the potential of using 2-HG as a prognostic marker and a target for noninvasive detection of IDH mutation status through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

While these antigens are not explicitly mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, their strong expression in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells suggests that they could be potential targets for immunotherapeutic approaches or tumor-targeting strategies. However, further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of these antigens in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
