- Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP): FAP is a cell surface glycoprotein that is highly expressed on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in various types of cancer, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The article mentions that FAP-positive CAFs contribute to immunosuppression and can be targeted for tumor imaging and therapy. FAP expression is associated with increased malignancy, poor prognosis, and tumor metastasis in gastric cancer. The study also highlights the potential of 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT imaging as a non-invasive biomarker to predict outcomes of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in gastric cancer patients.
