The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- **HLA-I**: The study found no significant difference in the expression levels of HLA-A, B, or C between HMP and NHMP samples in either IDH-mutant or IDH-wildtype tumors. This suggests that HLA expression is unlikely to be the cause of the different correlation of TMB and immune scores in IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype gliomas.

- **Antigen Processing and Presentation (APP)**: The APP score was significantly higher in NHMP samples compared to HMP samples in IDH-wildtype tumors, but higher in HMP samples versus NHMP in IDH-mutant gliomas. The APP score also had a statistically significant correlation with immune score in gliomas. These data indicate that APP function is different between HMP and NHMP samples with different IDH mutation status but correlates with immune score in the sample cohort.

- **Immunosuppressive Genes**: The study analyzed the expression of well-known immunosuppressive genes and found that PD1 and PDL1 showed a statistically significant difference in expression between NHMP and HMP samples in IDH-wildtype gliomas. This suggests a potential therapeutic role of targeting PD1/PDL1 in IDH-wildtype gliomas.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
