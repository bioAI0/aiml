The paper does not provide specific information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of glioblastoma and other cancer types:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): FAP is a membrane protease that is highly expressed in many tumors, including glioblastoma, but is absent or insignificant in most normal tissues. The paper discusses the potential of FAP as a biomarker for glioma detection and monitoring, as well as its role in tumor progression.

- Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2): These molecular biomarkers play a role in patient stratification, delineation of risk groups, and prognostication of treatment response in glioma. The paper mentions that IDH-wildtype gliomas have a worse prognosis compared to IDH-mutant gliomas.

- O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT): MGMT is another molecular biomarker that influences the prognosis and treatment response in glioma. The paper discusses the methylation status of the MGMT promoter and its association with FAP levels.

While the paper does not explicitly mention these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, it highlights their potential as biomarkers for glioma diagnosis and monitoring. Further research and clinical studies would be needed to explore their role in immunotherapeutic approaches or targeted therapies for glioblastoma.
