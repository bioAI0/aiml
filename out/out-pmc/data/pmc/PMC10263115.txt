- EGFR amplification: This antigen is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with the paper stating that none of the institutional or public subclonal astrocytomas exhibited additional molecular features typically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, including EGFR amplification.
- TERT promoter mutation: The paper notes that none of the institutional or public subclonal astrocytomas showed additional molecular features typically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, such as TERT promoter mutation.
- Gain of chromosome 7/loss of chromosome 10: The study found that none of the institutional or public subclonal astrocytomas displayed additional molecular features typically associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, including simultaneous gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10.

The paper does not provide specific information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
