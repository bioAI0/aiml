- PD-L1: This antigen is highly expressed in human malignant gliomas, and its levels significantly correlate with the glioma grade. It is also highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with intense positive staining for PD-L1 observed in Grade IV gliomas, anaplastic astrocytoma, and GBM. The reported positivity of PD-L1 expression in GBM ranges from 61% to 88%. PD-L1 expression is controlled through the innate immune resistance mechanism by the constitutive oncogenic signaling, PI3K-AKT pathway in tumor cells.
- PD-L2: This antigen is exclusively expressed on APCs, including DCs and macrophages under homeostasis, and can be induced in a variety of other immune cells or non-immune cells in response to microenvironmental stimuli. In certain subsets of B cell lymphomas, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, follicular cell B cell lymphoma, and mediastinal B cell lymphoma, PD-L2 is highly up-regulated. The up-regulation of PD-L2 in lymphomas may result from the gene fusions between the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) transactivator (CIITA) and PD-L2.
- PD-1: This antigen is an inhibitory receptor mainly expressed on activated T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. It is also detectable on other lymphocyte subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells and B cells. The elevated expression of PD-1 has been detected in diverse advanced human cancers, such as melanoma, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. The immunosuppressive activities of receptor PD-1 are initiated upon binding to one of its two ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, and mediated through multiple mechanisms.
- CTLA-4: This antigen is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and the first co-inhibitory molecule identified. It is not expressed by naive T cells but is rapidly induced in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon T-cell activation. The predominant functions of CTLA-4 are attributed to the effects on the two major subsets of CD4+ T cells: suppression of helper T cell activity and enhancement of Treg immunosuppression. The ligands of CTLA-4 are CD80 and CD86, both of which also signal through the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 and induce T-cell activation. Since CTLA-4 has a much higher affinity for both ligands than CD28, it effectively inhibits the ligand engagement to CD28, transduces inhibitory signals, and suppresses T-cell activation. Forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), a forkhead transcription factor, controls CTLA-4 expression. In return, when CTLA-4 is induced in Tregs, CTLA-4 mediates the down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86 on DCs, and thus reduces the potency of APCs to activate other T cells, critically controlling the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. In addition, CTLA-4 expressed by Tregs could bind to CD80/86 on DCs with high affinity, and then deliver a signal that induces IDO expression and triggers the IDO activity in DCs.
- IDO: This antigen is expressed by various tumor cells and DCs. Although not an immune checkpoint in the classical sense, IDO mediates several inhibitory pathways in various tumor types and suppresses anti-tumor immunity as a mammalian cytosolic enzyme. IDO is a tryptophan (Trp) catabolic enzyme responsible for Trp degradation through the kynurenine (Kyn) degradation pathway. IDO from tumor cells catabolizes Trp to numerous metabolites, including Kyn, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA). The maintenance and function of T cells require Trp. Therefore, the Trp degradation mediated by IDO suppresses T cell activation. Meanwhile, the metabolites, such as Kyn, 3-HK, and 3-HAA induce T cell apoptosis. In addition, when combined with TGF-β, Kyn could induce FoxP3 expression and stimulate Treg formation. And IDO expressed by tumor cells also induces Treg infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Together, these mechanisms exacerbate immune suppression associated with cancer development. In glioma, IDO expressed in glioma cells plays an important role in inhibiting T cell functions and contributes to Treg accumulation. Under normal physiology, the CNS parenchyma does not express IDO. However, 90% of GBM shows positive expression of IDO, which is further boosted in low-grade glioma, suggesting that IDO expression level correlates with the severity of glioma. Moreover, GBM patients with higher expression of IDO have a worse prognosis. However, a recent study showed that only 8% of GBM expressed IDO. Considering that the antibodies used in these studies, although different from one another, were all well-controlled for the detection specificity, these studies suggest that alternative splice variants and/or posttranslational modifications of IDO protein in GBM samples may result in antigenic variations, and thus the dichotomous findings of IDO in GBM.
- TIM-3: This antigen is mainly expressed on activated T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. It binds to galectin-9, through which it induces Th1 cell death and suppresses the anti-tumor immune response. The significance of TIM-3 has been demonstrated in different cancer models, including colon cancer, mammary carcinoma, and melanoma. In glioma patients, the expression of TIM-3 on CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells is significantly elevated compared to healthy controls, and the higher expression level of TIM-3 on T cells is associated with tumors of higher grades.
- KIRs (Killer inhibitory receptors): These are a collection of inhibitory receptors that can down-regulate NK cells' cytotoxic activity and inhibit cytokine secretion of NK cells. Many KIRs are also expressed on T cells and APCs. Activation of KIRs in T cells suppresses the cytolytic activities of these cells. Consistently, expressions of KIRs are detected in multiple cancer types and correlate with poor prognosis. Among KIRs, CD94/NKG2A is an NK inhibitory receptor expressed by most astrocytoma-infiltrating T cells. An anti-NKG2A antibody (IPH2201) is undergoing phase I/II trial testing in HNSCC patients (NCT02331875). This antibody could be applied to glioma clinical trials. Many other anti-KIR mAbs are also being tested in anti-tumor clinical trials. A phase I trial of anti-KIR (IPH2101) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia has been completed. Several studies involving anti-KIR (lirilumab) combined with anti-PD-1 (clinical trial NCT01714739) or with anti-CTLA4 (clinical trial NCT01750580) are undergoing on patients with hematologic and solid cancers. These trials will investigate the anti-cancer effect by simultaneously boosting both the innate immune activity, via anti-KIR, and the adaptive immune activity via anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4.
- VISTA: This antigen is a member of the CD28 receptor family and is mainly expressed on myeloid and granulocytic cells, including naive T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs, but not on B cells. Through the interaction with an unknown receptor on T cells, VISTA negatively inhibits T cell responses: not only T-cell proliferation, but also the expression of activation markers and the production of cytokines. In vitro, VISTA induces the development of Tregs with the help of TGF-β. In line with its biological activities, VISTA-KO mice are resistant to the development of GL261 glioma. In addition, when combined with a cancer vaccine, VISTA blockade inhibits tumor growth. In a glioma mouse model, GL261 cells were directly injected into the left cerebral hemisphere of WT or VISTA-KO mice, and the tumor growth was monitored and recorded using an imaging technique system all the time. WT mice tumors died within 35 days after GL261 inoculation, while no tumor developed in approximately 20% of VISTA-KO mice. Therefore, targeting VISTA may present potent therapeutic efficacy on glioma.
