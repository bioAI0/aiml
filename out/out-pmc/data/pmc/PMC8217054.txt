- Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): GFAP is a well-known marker for glial cells and is commonly used in the diagnosis of glioblastoma. In this study, 84% (21/25) of cases showed negative GFAP staining in embryonal-appearing tumor cells.
- Tumor protein 53 (p53): p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that is often mutated in cancer. In this study, almost all cases (27/29) presented with strong nuclear staining for p53 in the embryonal tumor component.
- Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1): TTF1 is a transcription factor involved in the development of the thyroid, lung, and brain. In this study, 77.8% (14/18) of cases showed positive staining of the nuclei of tumor cells for TTF1 using the EP229 clone in embryonal, GFAP-negative tumor components only. Conventional glioblastomas, including small cell variants, were all negative for this clone.
- Synaptophysin: Synaptophysin is a synaptic vesicle protein commonly used as a marker for neuroendocrine tumors. In this study, 85.7% (12/14) of embryonal tumor parts were positive for synaptophysin.
- Neuron-specific enolase (NSE): NSE is an enzyme found in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. All tumors tested (9/9) showed positivity for NSE.
- Retinoblastoma protein (Rb): Rb is a tumor suppressor protein involved in cell cycle regulation. In this study, none of the cases showed a clear loss of nuclear expression for Rb.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
