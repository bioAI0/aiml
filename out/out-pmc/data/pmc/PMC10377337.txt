I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- MDM2
- p53

MDM2 is a protein that is upregulated in a multitude of cancers, including glioblastoma, and is associated with a poor prognosis. Gene amplification, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region, increased transcription, and enhanced translation of MDM2 may cause an enhanced degradation and decreased activity of p53. MDM2 amplification is the most frequent cause of MDM2 overexpression and occurs in approximately 3.5% of all malignancies. Up to 65% of well-differentiated and de-differentiated liposarcomas have a high rate of MDM2 amplification, while several other solid malignancies, including GBM, soft-tissue and bone sarcomas, gallbladder and duodenal adenocarcinoma, lung adenosquamous carcinoma, and ovarian carcinosarcoma, have a frequency of approximately 15%. In most tumors, MDM2 amplification is mutually exclusive to TP53 mutation.

p53 is the most frequently mutated gene across all types of cancer, with mutations occurring in about 50% of malignancies. The mutation prevalence of TP53 among different cancer types varies, ranging from less than 5% in cervical cancer to up to 90% in ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer. In lower grade (CNS WHO grade 2 and 3) gliomas, TP53 is deregulated in approximately 50% of cases, most commonly in co-occurrence with IDH1 mutations. The majority (>70%) of CNS WHO grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas harbor TP53 mutations. According to The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), TP53 is mutated in up to 30% of GBMs. While missense substitutions account for the most common TP53 mutations (~70%), other alterations, such as frameshift insertions/deletions, nonsense mutations, and silent mutations, are less common. Human cancers frequently have segmental deletions on chromosome 17p, which involves the TP53 locus. Although most TP53 mutations are detrimental (i.e., they cause a loss of function), some mutations in TP53 are innocuous, allowing p53 to continue acting as a transcription factor. There have also been reports of tumorigenic gain-of-function mutations in TP53.

The article mentions that the interaction between MDM2 and p53 has emerged as a promising strategy for combating cancer, including the treatment of glioblastoma. Numerous MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and are currently undergoing rigorous testing for their potential in GBM therapy. Encouraging results from studies conducted in cell culture and animal models suggest that MDM2 inhibitors could effectively treat a specific subset of GBM patients with wild-type TP53 or functional p53. Combination therapy with clinically established treatment modalities such as radiation and chemotherapy offers the potential to achieve a more profound therapeutic response. Furthermore, an increasing array of other molecularly targeted therapies are being explored in combination with MDM2 inhibitors to increase the effects of individual treatments. While some MDM2 inhibitors have progressed to early phase clinical trials in GBM, their efficacy, alone and in combination, is yet to be confirmed.

The article also discusses the potential of MDM2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma, highlighting the importance of the MDM2-p53 interaction in cancer development and the potential of targeting this interaction for cancer treatment. The article mentions that MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and are currently being explored for their possible use in cancer treatment, with some of these inhibitors having progressed to clinical testing. However, the article does not provide specific information on the expression levels of MDM2 and p53 across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
