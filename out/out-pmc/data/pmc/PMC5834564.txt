The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- **IDH-mutant tumor cells**: The paper discusses a vaccine developed against IDH-mutant tumor cells, which is currently being tested in a clinical trial. This vaccine aims to destroy cells expressing a mutant protein.
- **MGMT promoter methylation**: The paper highlights the importance of MGMT promoter methylation as a biomarker indicating a benefit from treatment with a specific alkylating agent, temozolomide. MGMT is a DNA repair protein, and its promoter methylation is associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide.
- **BRAF V600E mutation**: The paper mentions that BRAF V600E mutations are found in a range of low-grade IDH-wildtype glial and glioneuronal tumors, as well as in malignant variants. Inhibitor drugs interrupting the BRAF/MEK component of the MAP kinase pathway have been developed and trialled in both malignant and low-grade BRAF V600E mutant brain tumors.
- **Histone H3.3 K27M mutation**: The paper discusses histone H3.3 K27M mutations, which are highly specific and considered as "driver" mutations in high-grade gliomas. These mutations lead to a global reduction of trimethylated H3K27, and the level of trimethylation at this residue is regulated by the methylating enzyme EZH2 and the de-methylating JMJD3. Experimental preclinical studies have shown that targeting these enzymes could be a potential treatment strategy for histone-mutant gliomas.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
