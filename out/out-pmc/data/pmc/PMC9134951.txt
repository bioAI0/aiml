- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - TNC (Tenascin-C)
   - C1RL (Complement C1q Receptor-Like)
   - FABP5 (Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5)
   - CSTA (Cystatin A)
   - BCL3 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3)

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - TNC: Highly expressed in glioblastoma, especially in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
   - C1RL: Upregulated in glioblastoma, particularly in mesenchymal and primary glioblastoma.
   - FABP5: Correlated with an undifferentiated tumor phenotype in glioblastoma.
   - CSTA: Upregulated in human malignant gliomas, especially in invasive GBMs.
   - BCL3: Overexpressed in various cancers, including breast cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, endometrial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer.

- **Mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - TNC: Printed peptide arrays identified prognostic TNC serum antibodies in glioblastoma patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker.
   - C1RL: C1RL-associated genes are enriched in immune response processes, and C1RL expression is correlated with reduced tumor purity and increased M2 macrophage infiltration in glioblastoma.
   - FABP5: A known tumor-associated antigen that can respond to B cells.
   - CSTA: CSTA-positive cells are located close to tumor blood vessels and inflammatory host cells in GBM tumor samples, indicating its potential role in the tumor microenvironment.
   - BCL3: BCL3 expression promotes resistance to alkylating chemotherapy in gliomas. In ovarian cancer, BCL3 induces immune checkpoint PD-L1 expression, mediating cancer cell proliferation.
