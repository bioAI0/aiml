- CD163: This antigen is expressed on tumor-associated macrophage cells in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is also found in other cancer types, such as colorectal cancer and liver cancer. CD163 has been implicated in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastoma, and its expression is associated with poor prognosis.
- HMOX1: Heme Oxygenase-1 is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is negatively associated with overall survival. It is also expressed in other cancer types, including colorectal cancer and liver cancer. HMOX1 is involved in the activation of the STAT3 pathway, which induces IL-10 production and contributes to the immunosuppressive environment.
- EGFR: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor is expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with the mesenchymal-like and astrocytic-like transcriptional signatures. EGFR is a well-known target for cancer therapy, and its expression has been linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis in various cancer types.
- CHI3L1: This antigen is expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with the mesenchymal-like transcriptional signature. CHI3L1 has been implicated in the immunosuppressive microenvironment and is a potential target for immunotherapy.
- HOPX: HOP homeobox is expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with the astrocytic-like transcriptional signature. HOPX has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation and may play a role in tumor progression.
- OLIG1: Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 is expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with the oligodendrocyte-progenitor cell (OPC) cluster. OLIG1 is a key regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and may be involved in the development of glioblastoma.
- CD24: This antigen is expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with the neural progenitor cell (NPC)-like transcriptional signature. CD24 has been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration and may play a role in tumor progression.
- CD163+ HMOX1+ myeloid cells: These cells are characterized by the expression of CD163 and HMOX1 and are found in close proximity to exhausted T cells in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. They are involved in the release of IL-10 and contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.
- CD3+ IBA1+ doublets: These cells contain myeloid-lymphoid cell pairs and are assumed to be physically connected. They express both CD3 and IBA1 and are found in close proximity to exhausted T cells in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- CD163+ HMOX1+ IBA1+ myeloid cells: These cells are characterized by the expression of CD163, HMOX1, and IBA1 and are found in close proximity to exhausted T cells in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. They are involved in the release of IL-10 and contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment.
