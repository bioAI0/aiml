- **OAS1**: OAS1 is an interferon-inducible gene that encodes a protein involved in the innate immune response. It may affect the prognosis of GBM in a TRIM5-dependent manner.
- **HOXA5**: HOXA5 is a transcription factor that has been associated with the tumorigenic potential of glioma stem cells. Increased expression of HOXA5 has been linked to poor prognosis in GBM.
- **UBE2S**: UBE2S is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that is associated with the activity of the PI3K-Akt pathway in GBM. It may serve as a therapeutic target.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and their expression levels are not discussed across different cancer types. There is no mention of these antigens in relation to immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text.
