I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on the use of 18F-FET PET imaging to identify differences in uptake characteristics and tumour volume between long-term and short-term survivors of IDH-wildtype diffuse gliomas. It does not discuss antigens or their expression levels in cancer cells.
