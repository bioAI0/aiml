- **Olig2**: A transcription factor that is highly expressed in diffuse gliomas and pilocytic astrocytomas. It is also a significant marker for glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly therapy-resistant and play a major role in tumor recurrence and invasion. The study found that higher expression of Olig2 was associated with significantly shorter overall survival in the univariate analysis of the patient cohort at the 5% and 10% cut-offs, but statistical significance was lost in the multivariate analysis.
- **Nestin**: A type VI intermediate filament that is mainly expressed in precursor neurons and identified as a marker for glioma stem cells. The study found that Nestin expression has no independent prognostic impact in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- **Nogo-A**: A neurite outgrowth inhibitor that was successfully utilized for the differentiation of oligodendrogliomas from other gliomas. The study found a heterogeneous expression of Nogo-A in glioblastoma, but no correlation with age, clinical status, MGMT-promoter methylation status, or overall survival.
- **AQP4**: A highly regulated water channel protein in the central nervous system that is frequently expressed in glioblastoma and is associated with glioma invasion and migration. The study found no differences in age, clinical status, MGMT-promoter methylation, or prognosis at different expression cut-offs.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
