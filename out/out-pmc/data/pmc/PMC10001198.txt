I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
- EGFR amplification

EGFR is a well-known antigen that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The paper mentions that EGFR amplification is a genomic alteration found in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, which is associated with a worse prognosis.

The paper does not provide specific information about the expression levels of EGFR across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, EGFR is a widely studied target for cancer immunotherapy, and its expression levels can vary across different cancer types.

I did not find any other antigens that met your criteria in the provided text.
