I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- GLUT3: GLUT3 is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, particularly in the classical and proneural GBM subtypes, via PAK4-YAP/TAZ signaling.
- HK2: Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma tissue, and its expression is associated with PTEN mutations.
- GLUT1: GLUT1 is highly expressed in quiescent endothelial cells in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

Regarding expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that GLUT3 is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but it does not provide information on its expression in other cancer types. Similarly, HK2 is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but the paper does not compare its expression in other cancer types.

The paper does not mention GLUT1, GLUT3, or HK2 in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, it does discuss the potential of targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, including the use of glycolytic inhibitors and mTOR kinase inhibitors.
