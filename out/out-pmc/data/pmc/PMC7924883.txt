   - MC1 receptors are overexpressed in leukocytes, melanocytes, and transformed melanoma cells.
   - NK1 receptors are expressed in various cell systems, including immune cells, monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, microglia, dendritic cells, bone marrow stem cells, and others.

- **Mentions of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - FAP is associated with fibrosis, inflammation, and cancer. It is undetectable in a majority of normal adult tissues. FAP has been localized in activated fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. The participation of FAP in cell invasiveness, proliferation, migration, and tumor vascularization has been described. FAP overexpression and activation have been observed in various malignancies, e.g., pancreatic, hepatocellular, lung, breast, colorectal, or ovarian.
   - PSMA is a membrane-bound folate gamma glutamyl-carboxypeptidase II, which is physiologically present in various tissues. It is primarily expressed in benign and malignant prostatic tissue. Studies have also shown its expression in breast, gastric, colorectal, lung, and renal carcinomas, as well as brain tumors. PSMA has become one of the most promising and extensively evaluated molecular targets in nuclear medicine.
   - Integrin αvβ3 is associated with angiogenesis, tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Its expression has been demonstrated in various endothelial and cancer cells.
   - SSTR is a physiological hormone that regulates an endocrine and exocrine secretion throughout a human body. Its biological effects are mediated via 5 types of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) belonging to a G-protein coupled receptors family. SSTR, its analogues, and receptors have become increasingly popular and widely studied because of anti-tumor effects and mechanisms, including GEP-NETs, pituitary adenomas, breast cancer, small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, etc. The most commonly expressed receptor subtype in tumor cells is SSTR2, followed by SSTR1, SSTR5, SSTR3, and SSTR4 as the least expressed subtype.
   - GRPR is a 14 AA peptide analogue to the gastrin-releasing peptide. It represents an interesting probe for targeting of gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPR) relevant in oncology. Four receptors belong to the family of GRPR, namely neuromendin B receptor BBR1, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor BBR2, orphan receptor BBR3, and amphibious receptor BBR4. Predominantly the BBR2 is upregulated in cancer cells such as breast, lung, pancreas, colon, and prostate.
   - CCK is a peptide hormone that regulates various actions predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. It was initially characterized with a 33 AA sequence, but later, the peptide was shown to be present in more biologically active forms (e.g., CCK4, CCK8, CCK33, CCK39) derived from a 115 AA precursor. A total of three types of CCK receptors from the G-protein coupled receptors family have been identified, CCK1 known as CCK A, CCK2 known as CCK B, and CCK2i4sv receptor, respectively. The extensively studied receptors are CCK1, characterized in pancreatic cells and mainly located in periphery, and CCK2 located in the brain, stomach, pancreas, and gall bladder, and overexpressed in cancer types such as small cell lung cancers and medullary thyroid carcinomas.
   - GLP-1 is an intestinal peptide hormone with a 36 AA sequence. It stimulates insulin secretion. An action of the GLP-1 and its analogues is mediated through a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor as a class B of G-protein-coupled receptor. The GLP-1 receptor was identified by radioligand binding experiments and is expressed mainly in the stomach, pancreas, and brain. The GLP-1 receptor has been found predominantly in insulinomas, gastrinoma, pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, and medullary thyroid cancer.
   - NT is a neurotransmitter and hormone with a sequence of 13 AA. The C-terminal NT(8–13) is responsible for affinity and activity to a NT receptor. There are three types of the NT receptors: NTR1–NTR3, where NTR1 is an extensively studied receptor and a promising target for cancer imaging. The NTR1 overexpression has been demonstrated in a tumor progression, e.g., in pancreas and colon adenoma, but also in breast, lung, or prostate cancer.
   - MC1 is a neuropeptide with a sequence of 13 AA that is selectively bound to a melanocortine-1 receptor (MC1) overexpressed in leukocytes, melanocytes, and transformed melanoma cells. It is primarily responsible for a regulation of inflammatory state and skin pigmentation.
   - Substance P is a family of tachykinins and exerts its activity through the G protein-coupled neurokinin receptors (NKR), i.e., NK1R–NK3R, with the highest affinity of NK1R. It has been found in various cell systems bearing NK1R, such as immune cells, monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, microglia, dendritic cells, bone marrow stem cells, and others. In the central nervous system, NK1R are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and cerebral endothelial cells. Effects of the substance P in human organism include immune and secretion stimulation, smooth muscle contraction (pulmonary, urinary, GIT, and vascular system), and is involved also in a pain transmission, vasodilatation, connective-tissue cell proliferation, and neuroimmune modulation.
   - VIP is a peptide with a 28 AA sequence that regulates various immune cells, promotes vasodilatation, growth, and function of tumor cells. Its biological action is mediated through three classes of the G-protein-coupled receptors VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1. The receptors for VIP occur in numerous tumor cells, including thyroid, breast, lung, liver, pancreas, intestinal epithelial cells, colon, bladder, prostate, uterus, and neuroendocrine tumors.
