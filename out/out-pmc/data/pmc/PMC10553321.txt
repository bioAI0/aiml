- PRAME (PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma)
- PRAME is a cancer-testis antigen that is expressed by melanoma cells and was isolated by autologous T cells in a melanoma patient.
- PRAME expression is used to support the diagnosis of melanoma over nevus in combination with histopathological features and other findings.
- The expression of the PRAME gene and PRAME protein can be practically evaluated by pigmented lesion assay (PLA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively.
- Although PRAME has its primary application in the diagnosis of melanoma, PRAME was also found to be expressed by various epithelial and non-epithelial cancers, including uterine carcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, ovarian carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, seminoma, thymic carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, synovial sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and neuroblastoma.
- The biological and clinicopathological implications of PRAME expression have been unknown in adult gliomas.
- PRAME has been recently introduced as a prognostic and/or oncogenic biomarker of various cancer types, including melanocytic neoplasms, invasive breast carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and hematological malignancies.
- PRAME has also been found to be expressed by various types of neoplasms as mentioned earlier.
- Regarding CNS tumors, the significance of PRAME expression has been investigated in medulloblastoma as a biomarker for immunotherapy.
- Little is known about the biological and clinical significance of the PRAME protein and its corresponding gene in glioma.
- The intensity and pattern of PRAME and its gene expression in glioma are still under investigation.
- In the present study, the authors found that most of these tumors still expressed PRAME at a low level and a minority of them, however, showed gene overexpression.
- Even with low expression, the PRAME-expressing glioma still had distinct biological characteristics, which was shown in subsequent analyses.
- Further studies to validate PRAME protein expression in glioma, using western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, or other techniques, are needed because it is not clear whether PRAME gene expression can be an indicator of its protein status.
- The nCounter Nanostring PanCancer Pathways panel was used to evaluate the biological profiles of human cancers in previous studies.
- Using this panel, the authors' PCA analysis illustrated that PRAME expression status can be a biomarker of glioma biology although further interpretations are not available in such general results.
- Pathway analysis showed more details in the biological difference among PRAME expression statuses.
- In glioma, the Wnt/Î²-catenin signal promotes neurogenesis and cell proliferation while the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is associated with growth, metabolism, autophagy, survival, and chemotherapy resistance of glioblastoma.
- The hedgehog signaling pathway is also required for glioma-initiating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
- These pathways were increased in PRAME-positive gliomas.
- However, various oncogenic processes or signals in PRAME-positive gliomas such as E2F targets, G2M mitotic checkpoint, reactive oxidative oxygen species, IL6-JAK-STAT6, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and mTORC1 were activated at the lower levels compared to PRAME-negative tumors.
- These results were controversial, suggesting biological heterogeneity in PRAME-positive tumors.
- Recent studies showed dozens of clinicopathological risk factors with prognostic significance in adult gliomas.
- Clinically, age, tumor size, and tumor location within CNS are predictive factors of glioma patient outcomes.
- Pathologically, histological glioma subtypes and WHO grade are also related to glioma prognosis.
- Regarding genetic abnormalities, CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, EGFR amplification, TP53 mutations, ATRX mutations, TERT promoter mutations, and 7 gain 10 loss chromosomal abnormalities are associated with poor prognosis while IDH1/2 mutations are closely related to superior outcomes.
- Regarding gene expression, a previous study developed a stemness index from the regularized cox model to predict the prognosis of glioma patients.
- Therefore, it is important to show the prognostic significance of a biomarker by adjusting such confounders in a multivariate analysis.
- In the present study, the authors found that PRAME positivity was an independent prognostic factor to other clinicopathological factors.
- Interestingly, the authors found that PRAME gene overexpression, which is more likely visualized by the protein expression detection methods, was related to a subgroup with a significantly worse prognosis than PRAME-low gliomas despite its small sample size.
- DNA methylation profile was proven to be pathologically associated with CNS tumors.
- A methylation-based random forest classifier was developed to provide a novel biological fingerprint of CNS tumors in addition to other identifiers such as histopathology and genetic abnormalities.
- Another study also argued that methylation profiling can be a reliable biomarker for further low-grade glioma subtyping.
- Therefore, examining whether there is a relationship between PRAME expression status and DNA methylation characteristics can further consolidate PRAME value in glioma biology.
- The authors' study showed that PRAME-positive gliomas were distributed more densely in the IDH-wildtype-related methylation cluster compared to the other cluster.
- Although this specific distribution of PRAME-positive tumors can be attributed to the dense clustering of grade 4 tumors, the authors believe that PRAME positivity and negativity can still be an indicator of DNA methylation profile, regardless of the causal relationships.
- PRAME can also be associated with glioma TME.
- A previous study showed that Decitabine can increase PRAME expression and, thus, enhance the T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which makes PRAME an interesting target for immunotherapy.
- However, TME of cell line can be difficult to interpret because the stromal or microenvironment context of cancer in vivo is different from that of cell line condition.
- The authors' study showed that PRAME higher expression was related to increased cytotoxic cell, macrophage, and neutrophil activity but it was also associated with many immune modulating cells such as Th2, Th17, and TFH.
- Therefore, PRAME expression is in a complicated relationship with many immunologic cell populations, not only cytotoxic T cells.
- However, there were limitations in the present study.
- First, selection bias was a potential problem because this study used a public database.
- Second, the authors' findings of PRAME positivity in IDH-mutant glioma were not significant potentially due to small samples, and, thus, sampling error.
- Therefore, a larger study of PRAME expression on IDH-mutant glioma can be helpful to examine the biological and clinicopathological relevance of PRAME positivity in these brain tumors.
- Third, protein expression data was not fully available and, therefore, cannot be analyzed.
- PRAME gene expression may be different from PRAME protein expression, which can be practically evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
- Hence, immunohistochemical studies are required to validate PRAME prognostic significance at the protein level.
- Additionally, data about histone modification is not available in TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM projects.
- Therefore, the authors were not able to analyze the relationship between PRAME expression and this epigenetic regulation.
- Finally, to the authors' knowledge, there was no available information of chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance in TCGA datasets.
- Hence, the authors were not able to investigate the relationship between PRAME expression and treatment response.
- The authors' study illustrated that a proportion of glioma did not express PRAME while the majority of glioma expressed PRAME, among which a few tumors possessed high PRAME expression.
- PRAME-positive tumors had different biological (gene expression, DNA methylation, and pathway) and clinicopathological characteristics, which were related to IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- In survival analysis, PRAME positivity, especially PRAME overexpression, was related to poor prognosis.
