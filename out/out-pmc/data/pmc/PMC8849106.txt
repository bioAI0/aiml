I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
- IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutations
- MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase)
- TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase)

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as therapeutic targets for glioblastoma. For example, the authors mention that the EGFR amplification status is determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and that IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutations are tested by Sanger sequencing. The MGMT promoter status is determined by pyrosequencing, and patients are divided into methylated and unmethylated groups based on the average methylation level.

The paper also highlights the importance of distinguishing treatment-induced responses, such as pseudoprogression and radionecrosis, from true progression for subsequent clinical decision-making and prognosis assessment. Advanced imaging techniques, such as MR spectrum (MRS), perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), and PET, are used to distinguish these responses.

In terms of expression levels across different cancer types, the paper does not provide specific information on the expression levels of these antigens in other cancer types. However, it does mention that IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is one of the most lethal malignancies and exhibits high molecular, temporospatial, and radiological intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity. The authors also discuss the importance of considering non-contrast-enhancing tumors in glioblastoma research, as these tumors can also progress rapidly and evolve into contrast-enhancing tumors.

Overall, the paper suggests that these antigens could be potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but further research is needed to fully understand their expression levels and therapeutic potential in different cancer types.
