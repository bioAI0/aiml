- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - EGFR
   - ERBB2
   - CTNNB1

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - EGFR: The expression of EGFR is often associated with high-grade gliomas.
   - ERBB2: ERBB2 has been implied as an appropriate target for CAR T cells in glioblastoma.
   - CTNNB1: CTNNB1 mutations in the ovary are characteristic features of ovarian carcinomas.

- **Immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - EGFR: The retinoblastoma RB1 gene is a tumor suppressor, and its status is identified as a determinant of glioblastoma therapeutic efficacy.
   - ERBB2: ERBB2 has been implied as a target for CAR T cells in glioblastoma.
   - CTNNB1: The expression of CTNNB1 was substantially higher in IDH1WT gliomas than in IDH1MUT, indicating a correlation with the immunosuppressive microenvironment.
