The paper does not provide information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the use of an oncolytic adenovirus that targets fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in the tumor stroma, which is highly expressed in various types of cancer. This approach aims to deplete stromal cells expressing FAP and potentially improve the efficacy of cancer treatment.
