- IDH1: IDH1 is a prognostic marker for glioma, with IDH1 mutations associated with a favourable prognosis and IDH1 wildtype associated with lower overall survival. IDH1 is also used in the diagnosis of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, with IDH1 wildtype characterising glioblastomas.
- IDH2: IDH2 mutations are also favourable prognostic factors and can facilitate the diagnosis of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, while IDH2 wildtype is associated with lower overall survival and characterises glioblastomas.
- MGMT: MGMT promoter methylation is a favourable prognostic factor associated with enhanced sensitivity to alkylating agents in chemotherapy.
- ATRX: ATRX mutations are associated with wildtype 1p/19q and with mutations in IDH1/2 and TP53, and may be involved in alternative lengthening of telomeres, contributing to genomic instability.
- TP53: TP53 is a prognostic factor for glioma, with gain of function mutations in the TP53 gene causing overexpression of p53 protein, which is associated with shorter overall survival.
- P53: P53 expression is significantly positively correlated with age at diagnosis and is a prognostic marker for glioma.
- Palladin: Palladin is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for glioma, with overexpression of wild-type palladin's isoform 4 originating mostly from the malignant cell population and being involved in the progression of aggressive adult glioma tumours. Palladin expression is correlated with decreased survival and is a stronger predictor of overall survival than currently used prognostic markers.
