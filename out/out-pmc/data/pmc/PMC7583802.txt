The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention CD44 as a potential target antigen for immunotherapy or tumor targeting. CD44 is a cell surface adhesion receptor that is highly expressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma. The paper suggests that CD44 could be a promising target for immunotherapy or tumor targeting in glioblastoma, as it is upregulated in glioblastoma patients compared to healthy volunteers and plays a role in tumor progression.
