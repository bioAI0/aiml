The paper does not provide specific information on antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it mentions the following antigens in the context of immunohistochemical staining and molecular profiling:

- GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)
- OLIG2 (oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2)
- IDH1 R132H (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1)
- p53
- ATRX (alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)
- Ki-67
- MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1 (mismatch repair proteins)

These antigens are used for diagnostic and research purposes to identify and characterize different types of gliomas, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. The paper does not provide information on their expression levels across different cancer types or their potential as targets for immunotherapy.
