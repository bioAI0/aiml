I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
- Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
- Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2-A)

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as targets for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The paper also highlights the importance of understanding the molecular diversity of glioblastoma and its implications for any potential therapy, including immunotherapy.

Regarding expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that MGMT is found in 35%â€“45% of high-grade gliomas and is associated with a better response to chemotherapy. PTEN mutations are observed in a significant subset of glioblastoma, and EGFR amplification is also a common molecular genetic alteration associated with glioblastoma. However, the paper does not provide specific expression levels for these antigens across different cancer types.
