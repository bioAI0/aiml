I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET)
- 6-[18F]-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine ([18F]FDOPA)

Regarding their expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that the use of [18F]FDG for PET imaging is widespread in nuclear medicine, but its clinical use in neuro-oncological diseases is limited due to the high physiological uptake of glucose in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, resulting in a poor tumor-to-background ratio. On the other hand, glioma cells have a distinctly increased nutritional demand for amino acids to enable rapid proliferation, and unlike glucose, normal brain tissue has a low physiological uptake of amino acids, providing a superior tumor-to-background contrast.

The paper also discusses the use of positron-emitting nuclide-labelled amino acids as interesting probes for imaging gliomas in the pre- and post-treatment setting using PET. The main amino acid tracers used for glioma imaging are [11C]MET, [18F]FET, and [18F]FDOPA, all of which are taken up by the cell from the extracellular space via the Na+-independent system L-type amino acid transporter.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper mentions that the combination of PET imaging and PWI has been suggested to further improve the overall diagnostic accuracy of the differentiation of TP from TRA. A stepwise approach, where PWI-MRI is used to select cases for which PET imaging is most useful, can also increase diagnostic accuracy. The combination of exactly which PWI and PET technique is most optimal is not known and should be determined by the level of local expertise. More prospective, blinded research is needed to investigate whether PET imaging indeed adds diagnostic value when PWI is inconclusive.
