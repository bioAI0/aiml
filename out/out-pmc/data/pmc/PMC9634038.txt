- GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and vimentin: These antigens are highly expressed in GSCs (glioblastoma stem cells) and have been found in other models, although the specific cancer types are not mentioned.
- CD133, Sox2, and CD9: These antigens are expressed in GSC-like cells in the SVZ (subventricular zone) of GBM patients.
- Stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), C-X-C receptor type 4 (CXC4), osteopontin, and CD44: These chemokines and receptors are also expressed in GSC-like cells in the SVZ of GBM patients.
- Olig2, CD9, NG2, and PDGFRalpha: These markers are enriched in OPCs (oligodendrocyte progenitor cells) in GBM tumors.
- EGFR/SOX9+ and ERBB3/Sox10+: These gene expression signatures are associated with NSC (neural stem cell)-initiated and OPC-initiated tumors, respectively.

There is no specific information provided about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
