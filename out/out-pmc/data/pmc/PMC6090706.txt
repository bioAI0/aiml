- **Nestin**: A class VI intermediate filament protein and a marker for neural stem cells. It is also reported as a cancer stem cell-specific marker and its increased expression is associated with higher histological grade in glioma patients. Nestin expression is positively correlated with tumor recurrence and glioma cell infiltration into intact brain tissue. In the paper, nestin staining was used to discriminate between patient-derived fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells in ring co-culture experiments.

- **Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)**: Although GFAP is not exclusively expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, it is mentioned in the paper that GFAP can also stain fibroblasts, which is in accordance with observations made by others.

- **Homeobox Protein C9 (HOXC9)**: Overexpression of HOXC9 in breast cancer cell lines resulted in increased invasiveness but inhibited proliferation, suggesting a potential role in the "go or grow" concept. However, the exact mechanisms and downstream targets responsible for its effects on proliferation and invasion are still unknown.

- **Y-box Binding Protein-1 (YB-1)**: Enforced expression of YB-1 in non-invasive breast epithelial cells induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to an enhanced metastatic potential while reducing proliferation. Similar to HOXC9, the mechanisms behind YB-1's dual role in proliferation and invasion are not fully understood.

The paper does not provide specific expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or discuss their implications in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
