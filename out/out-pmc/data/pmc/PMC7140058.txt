I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The text does not mention any specific antigens or their expression levels across different cancer types. Additionally, there are no references to immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of these antigens.
