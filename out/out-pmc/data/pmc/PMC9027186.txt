I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- LAT1: LAT1 is a sodium-independent L-type amino acid transporter that is highly expressed on tumor cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is involved in the uptake of amino acid tracers, such as MET and FET, which are used for the diagnosis of glioma recurrence. LAT1 expression is related to the density of LAT on the cell membrane surface, and its activity is highly specific for tumor cells, making it a promising target for tumor imaging and therapy.

- LAT2: LAT2 is another amino acid transporter that is involved in the uptake of amino acid tracers, such as FDOPA. However, LAT2 is more tumor-selective than LAT1, and its expression is not directly proportional to tumor differentiation status. FDOPA uptake occurs through both LAT1 and LAT2, but LAT2 is more selectively transported through LAT2.
