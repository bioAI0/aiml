The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- **β-catenin**: The paper discusses the role of β-catenin in promoting monocyte migration towards glioblastoma cells and its potential as a therapeutic target.
- **CCL2**: CCL2 is mentioned as a factor that, together with β-catenin, promotes monocyte migration towards glioblastoma cells.
- **MCT-1**: MCT-1 is a lactate transporter that is transcriptionally upregulated by β-catenin-mediated promoter activation, leading to increased aerobic glycolysis.
- **PDH, PKM2, LDH-A, SLC1A5, and GLUT1**: These are enzymes and transporters that are potentially activated by the canonical WNT pathway, leading to increased aerobic glycolysis.
- **ALDH3A1**: The paper mentions that WNT/β-catenin signaling downregulates the expression of ALDH3A1, which is associated with resistance to temozolomide in glioblastoma.
- **ZEB1**: ZEB1 is a transcription factor that is upregulated in highly clonogenic glioblastoma stem-like cells and is associated with nutrient flexibility.

The paper does not provide information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
