- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)

The above antigens are highly expressed on cancer cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and are mentioned in the context of tumor targeting and immunotherapy. FAP is a type II membrane-bound glycoprotein belonging to the DPP4 family, and its expression is associated with the regulation of the extracellular matrix. FAP is co-expressed with DPP4 in various tissues, including the alpha cells of Langerhans islets, multipotent bone marrow stromal cells, and the cervix and uterine stroma during the proliferative cycle.

The article discusses the development of FAP-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, such as 68Ga-FAPi-02 and 68Ga-FAPi-04, which have shown promising results in tumor imaging and radioligand therapy. These radiotracers bind to the enzymatic domain of FAP with high specificity and are rapidly internalized, leading to high intratumoral uptake and improved diagnostic performance in PET imaging. The use of chelators, such as DOTA, allows for the incorporation of therapeutic isotopes, enabling a theranostic approach.

The article also mentions the potential of FAPi-PET in the detection of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and its role in radiotherapy planning. FAPi-based PET/CT may be useful for non-invasive characterization of gliomas and their malignant progression, as elevated tracer uptake has been observed in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and WHO grade III/IV IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Additionally, FAPi-PET-based gross tumor volumes (GTVs) have shown significant increases compared to MRI GTVs, indicating the potential for improved target volume delineation in radiotherapy planning.
