- **Interleukin 13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2)**: IL13Rα2 is a cell-surface receptor that is positively expressed in 82% of GBM samples and >70% of glioma stem-like cancer-initiating cells. It was previously thought to be directly associated with increased mesenchymal signature gene expression and poor patient survival. For the treatment of recurrent GBM, Christine et al. showed the first-in-human clinical experience for CAR-engineered IL13Rα2-specific CD8+ CTL and observed significant tumor regression.
- **Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII)**: EGFRvIII is a negative prognostic indicator expressed in about 25–33% of all patients with GBMs and is the most commonly mutated gene among the EGFR family in glioma. In EGFRvIII-expressing newly diagnosed GBM, a peptide vaccine targeting EGFRvIII (rindopepimut) was previously evaluated and found to be well-tolerated, providing immune responses with prolonged progression-free survival. More recently, O’Rourke et al. conducted a phase I safety study of autologous CAR T cells targeted to EGFRvIII (CART-EGFRvIII) in 10 patients with recurrent GBMs. Intravenous infusion of a single dose of CART-EGFRvIII cells was found to be feasible and safe, without off-tumor toxicity or cytokine release syndrome.
- **Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)**: Elevated HER2 expression has been reported in 41% of primary GBM samples and in 81.4% of GBM primary cell lines and was correlated with impaired survival. In preclinical models of GBM, bispecific CAR molecules that incorporated 2 antigen recognition domains for HER2 and IL13Rα2 showed the functional superiority of T cell expressing antigens ex vivo and in an orthotopic GBM xenograft model. However, the safety concerns of autologous CART-HER2 cells were raised by the report of a serious adverse event following the administration of 1×1010 T cells of vaccine based on trastuzumab. While administration of up to 1×106/m2 CART-HER2 cells showed no evident toxicities, unfortunately, the expansion and persistence of CART-HER2 cells was limited. To treat HER2-positive GBM, Nabil Ahmed et al. developed HER2-specific CAR-modified virus-specific T cells (CAR VS Ts-HER2) with an FRP5-based exodomain and a CD28.ζ endodomain. Up to 1×108/m2 CAR VS Ts-HER2 were infused intravenously without dose-limiting toxic effects in 17 patients with progressive GBM. After the infusion, CAR VS Ts-HER2 was detectable in the peripheral blood for up to 12 months, with no observed expansion in peripheral blood (but expansion at GBM sites). Of 16 evaluable patients, 50% of patients had clinical benefit, as defined by a partial response (N=1, over 9 months) and stable disease (N=7, 8 weeks–29 months). Despite the feasibility and safety of CAR VS Ts-HER2, a clinical strategy using it alone or in combination with other immunomodulatory approaches is warranted to improve the anti-GBM activity of CAR VSTs-HER2 by augmenting their expansion and persistence.
