I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- PD-L1
- CTLA-4

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy, with the paper stating that high-risk patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma would benefit more from potential immunotherapy due to higher expression of checkpoint genes, such as PD-L1 and CTLA-4. The paper also suggests that the higher expression of these checkpoint genes could improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in these patients.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
