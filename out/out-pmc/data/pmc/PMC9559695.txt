- **Nestin and CD44:** These antigens were found to be widely expressed in both U87MG_mCherry and G7_mCherry orthotopic brain tumor models, irrespective of treatment groups.
- **MMP14:** This antigen was limited to a small subset of cells, mainly in the tumor border, which could reflect the invasion front.
- **Musashi 1:** This antigen was also primarily found in the tumor border, suggesting a potential role in the invasion zone.

The study does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it does mention the potential of these antigens as targets for immunotherapy or individualized therapeutic approaches. For instance, the authors suggest that mass spectrometry could be used to identify specific proteins as additional biomarkers for personalized treatment strategies. They also highlight the potential of using MALDI imaging to create a quantitative map distribution of EGFR inhibitors and tumor characteristics, which could help analyze drug resistance mechanisms and inform the development of tailored drug schedules.
