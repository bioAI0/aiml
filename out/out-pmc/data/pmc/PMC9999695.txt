The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular diagnostics:

- IDH1 R132H
- ATRX
- p53

These antigens are used as markers for specific mutations or alterations in glioma cells. For instance, IDH1 R132H is a mutation-specific marker for IDH1-mutant gliomas, while ATRX and p53 are associated with ATRX deficiency and p53 mutation, respectively.

The paper does not provide information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
