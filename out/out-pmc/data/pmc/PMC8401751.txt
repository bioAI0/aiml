- **IGFBP2:**
   - IGFBP2 is one of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) and is involved in lymphocyte proliferation.
   - It is expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has been explored as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various autoimmune diseases.
   - IGFBP2 expression is associated with the survival of GBM patients, with higher expression predicting shorter survival.
   - The article suggests that IGFBP2 expression may be a useful marker for GBM prognosis.
- **NOD2:**
   - NOD2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including oral lichen planus, Crohn's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.
   - It is expressed at higher levels in activated/memory CD4+ T cells and has been proposed as a diagnostic and treatment target for certain diseases.
   - A prognostic model for GBM patients was constructed using 9 immune genes, including NOD2, which predicted shorter survival.
- **TCF3:**
   - TCF3 is a transcription factor that contributes to the proliferative phenotype in Burkitt lymphoma and promotes B-cell-restricted genes through E-box motifs.
   - It can promote the survival of Burkitt's lymphoma cells by activating B-cell receptor signaling and PI3K signaling pathways and modulating cell cycle regulators.
   - TCF3 also promotes survival in lymphoid cells.
- **TYRO3:**
   - TYRO3 is a protein-coding gene involved in the ERK signaling pathway.
   - Higher levels of TYRO3 expression are associated with decreased overall survival in patients with colorectal, hepatocellular, and breast cancers.
   - While TYRO3 has not been directly linked to GBM, its prognostic value in this context should be further investigated.
