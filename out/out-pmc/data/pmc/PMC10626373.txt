I have found the following information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed by stromal fibroblasts in more than 90% of epithelial cancers, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas.
- FAP-specific PET/CT imaging has shown elevated tracer uptake in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas.
- The study by Röhrich et al. (2021) found that IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas showed elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.

The expression levels of FAP across different cancer types are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but the study by Röhrich et al. (2021) suggests that FAP is expressed in a variety of cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, grade III/IV IDH-mutant gliomas, and other solid tumors.

There is no mention of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text.
