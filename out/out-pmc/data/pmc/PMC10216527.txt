- **EGFR**: EGFR amplification is a characteristic molecular alteration in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is one of the key molecular criteria for the diagnosis of this cancer type. EGFR amplification is more specific for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma than TERT promoter mutations, and it is a strong surrogate marker for the diagnosis of glioblastoma in the absence of grade 4 histologic features. However, immunohistochemistry for EGFR has poor specificity for detecting this molecular alteration.
- **TERT**: TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent molecular alterations seen in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Some studies argue that TERT promoter mutations are sufficient for the diagnosis of glioblastoma and predict poor prognosis, while other studies suggest they have poor specificity as they can be encountered at an equal or greater frequency in oligodendroglioma and melanoma. TERT promoter mutations are also associated with multifocal glioblastomas.
- **CDKN2A/B**: CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion is linked to inferior clinical outcomes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is a poor prognostic marker.
- **MGMT**: MGMT promoter methylation is a favourable prognostic marker in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, showing greater overall and progression-free survival with improved response to alkylating agents and radiotherapy. MGMT codes for O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase, a DNA repair protein that diminishes the effects of alkylating agents used to treat these gliomas.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific roles in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
