I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- CD133: CD133 expression is associated with a shorter time to distant recurrence and is greater in SVZ+ tumors (determined by imaging) than in SVZ- tumors.
- GFAP: GFAP is a marker for the glial fibrillary acidic protein expressed by astrocytes and ependymal cells during development. It is also upregulated in GBM.
- Nestin: Nestin is an intermediate filament protein that is expressed by neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and is generally recognized as a marker of undifferentiated nervous system cells.
- SOX2: SOX2 is an HMG-Box transcription factor that is expressed in neural progenitor cells and is considered a marker of high pluripotency.
- Vimentin: Vimentin is a protein overexpressed in GSCs and NSCs, and it is implicated in various cancers, including GBM.

Regarding their expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that CD133 expression is associated with a shorter time to distant recurrence in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. GFAP is upregulated in GBM, and vimentin is overexpressed in GSCs and NSCs, indicating its potential oncogenic alteration of a normal NSC process.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper does not provide any specific information about these antigens. However, it is worth noting that the paper discusses the role of the SVZ in GBM and the potential for developing novel and effective therapeutic interventions using a combination of models.
