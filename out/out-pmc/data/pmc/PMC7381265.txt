I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The text focuses on the association between the extent of glioblastoma resection and survival in light of MGMT promoter methylation, without discussing antigens or their expression levels.
