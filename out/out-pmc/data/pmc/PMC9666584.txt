I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- CDKN2A/B
- MTAP
- TERT

These antigens are mentioned in the context of their genetic alterations and their impact on survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. The study found that CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP deletions predict worse overall survival, while TERT mutations are associated with worse survival only when treated with lower radiation doses.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
