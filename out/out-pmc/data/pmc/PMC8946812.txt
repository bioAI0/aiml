I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- **SPHK1**: SPHK1 is a sphingosine kinase that plays a role in the metabolism and signaling of sphingolipids. It is involved in the conversion of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is an active oncopromoter lipid with pleiotropic functions in cancer. In the context of glioblastoma, SPHK1 has been found to be highly expressed in fast-proliferating glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), where it contributes to the rapid degradation of newly synthesized ceramide (Cer) and the increased flux of Sph to S1P. This results in a 10-fold higher release of S1P in the extracellular milieu compared to slow-proliferating GSCs. SPHK1 is also upregulated in glioblastoma endothelial cells (GECs) when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, leading to increased S1P secretion and stimulation of glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation.

- **S1PR1**: S1PR1 is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to S1P and mediates its extracellular signaling. In glioblastoma, S1PR1 is involved in the autocrine/paracrine signaling of S1P, which stimulates glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation. S1PR1 is also expressed on platelets, which are the main source of circulating S1P due to their high SphK activity and lack of S1P lyase. The recruitment and activation of platelets on GEC surfaces lead to the release of S1P in the glioblastoma microenvironment, exacerbating glioblastoma aggressiveness.

- **S1PR3**: S1PR3 is another G protein-coupled receptor that binds to S1P and mediates its extracellular signaling. Similar to S1PR1, S1PR3 is involved in the autocrine/paracrine signaling of S1P in glioblastoma, contributing to the stimulation of glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation.

- **S1PR5**: S1PR5 is a G protein-coupled receptor that binds to S1P and mediates its extracellular signaling. However, the specific role of S1PR5 in glioblastoma is not mentioned in the paper.

- **SGPL1**: SGPL1 is a sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase that catalyzes the cleavage of S1P into ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal. This enzyme is involved in the degradation of S1P and the regulation of its signaling. In the context of glioblastoma, SGPL1 is downregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, leading to increased S1P secretion and stimulation of glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation.

- **SGPP1**: SGPP1 is a sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of S1P into sphingosine. This enzyme is involved in the regulation of S1P signaling and the maintenance of the "sphingolipid rheostat." In glioblastoma, SGPP1 is downregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, leading to increased S1P secretion and stimulation of glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation.

- **SGPP2**: SGPP2 is another sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of S1P into sphingosine. Similar to SGPP1, SGPP2 is downregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, contributing to the increased S1P signaling and stimulation of glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation.

- **ASAH1**: ASAH1 is an acid ceramidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid. This enzyme is involved in the degradation of ceramide and the regulation of its signaling. In glioblastoma, ASAH1 is downregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, leading to increased S1P secretion and stimulation of glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation.

- **ASAH2**: ASAH2 is another acid ceramidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid. Similar to ASAH1, ASAH2 is downregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, contributing to the increased S1P signaling and stimulation of glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation.

- **CERS1**: CERS1 is a ceramide synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of ceramide from sphingosine and a fatty acyl-CoA. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of ceramide and the regulation of its signaling. In glioblastoma, CERS1 is upregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, leading to increased ceramide production and a shift in the "sphingolipid rheostat" towards a pro-apoptotic signaling in tumor cells.

- **CERS2**: CERS2 is another ceramide synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of ceramide from sphingosine and a fatty acyl-CoA. Similar to CERS1, CERS2 is upregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, contributing to the increased ceramide production and the shift in the "sphingolipid rheostat" towards a pro-apoptotic signaling in tumor cells.

- **CERS4**: CERS4 is a ceramide synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of ceramide from sphingosine and a fatty acyl-CoA. Similar to CERS1 and CERS2, CERS4 is upregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, further enhancing the production of ceramide and the shift in the "sphingolipid rheostat" towards a pro-apoptotic signaling in tumor cells.

- **CERS5**: CERS5 is a ceramide synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of ceramide from sphingosine and a fatty acyl-CoA. Similar to the other CERS enzymes, CERS5 is upregulated in GECs when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, further increasing the production of ceramide and the shift in the "sphingolipid rheostat" towards a pro-apoptotic signaling in tumor cells.

- **CASPASE-3**: CASPASE-3 is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a critical role in the execution phase of apoptosis. It is the primary executioner of apoptotic death and is involved in the cleavage of various cellular proteins, leading to cell death. In the context of glioblastoma, CASPASE-3 is upregulated in GECs treated with metformin, indicating the activation of apoptotic processes and the inhibition of GEC survival.

- **CASPASE-7**: CASPASE-7 is another cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a supportive role in the execution phase of apoptosis. It causes an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and functions to detach cells from the extracellular matrix. In glioblastoma, CASPASE-7 is upregulated in GECs treated with metformin, further supporting the efficacy of metformin in inhibiting GEC survival.

- **CASPASE-10**: CASPASE-10 is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a role in the initiation of apoptosis. It is involved in the activation of other caspases, such as CASPASE-3 and CASPASE-7, and the cleavage of various cellular proteins. In glioblastoma, the expression of CASPASE-10 is not specifically mentioned, but the activation of apoptotic processes and the inhibition of GEC survival are observed in GECs treated with metformin.

- **ERK-1**: ERK-1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and survival. It is activated by various stimuli, including growth factors and stress signals, and mediates the phosphorylation of various substrates involved in cell growth and survival.

- **RAF**: RAF is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. It is activated by various stimuli, including growth factors and stress signals, and mediates the phosphorylation of MEK-1 and other MAPKKs. In glioblastoma, RAF is downregulated in GECs treated with metformin, indicating the inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway and the activation of apoptotic processes.

It is activated by various stimuli, including growth factors and stress signals, and mediates the recruitment and activation of RAF and other MAPKKKs. In glioblastoma, RAS is downregulated in GECs treated with metformin, indicating the inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway and the activation of apoptotic processes.

The paper does not provide specific information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it mentions that the "sphingolipid rheostat," which involves the balance between ceramide and S1P, is a potential target for cancer therapy. The paper also discusses the role of sphingolipids, particularly S1P, in the tumor microenvironment and their contribution to cancer progression.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper mentions that the "sphingolipid rheostat" and the enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism and signaling could be potential targets for cancer therapy. The paper also discusses the potential of metformin as an anti-cancer add-on therapy, suggesting that it could be used in combination with other targeted therapies to enhance their efficacy. However, the paper does not provide specific details on immunotherapy or tumor targeting strategies involving these antigens.
