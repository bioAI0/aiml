- **Collagen alpha-1(VI) chain (CO6A1)**: This protein is up-regulated in glioblastoma and down-regulated in normal tissues. It accumulates and forms deposits in perivascular tumor tissue and in pseudopalisading cells, suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis.
- **Neuron-glial-2 (NG2)**: This transmembrane chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan is up-regulated in glioblastoma and associated with a poor clinical outcome. It promotes drug resistance through PI3K/AKT survival signaling.
- **Annexin A2 (ANXA2)**: This protein is a candidate biomarker for malignant gliomas and is directly involved in angiogenesis-dependent invasion through the up-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
- **Polymerase 1 and transcript release factor complex (PTFR)**: This protein is involved in the metabolic pathways of tumor cells and is associated with the chemoresistance of glioblastoma to imatinib. It is expressed in both glioblastoma tissue and serum exosomes, and its silencing has been shown to suppress glioma progression in a murine model.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of glioblastoma, and their expression levels in other cancer types are not discussed in the provided text. Additionally, there is no mention of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
