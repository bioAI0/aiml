- SRPX2: SRPX2 is a secreted protein that plays a role in the extracellular matrix and has been associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma. It promotes tumour progression and metastasis in primary GICs. SRPX2 expression is highest in regions of microvascular proliferation and hyperplastic blood vessels, while it is lowest in the leading edge and infiltrating tumour. SRPX2 knockdown leads to impaired invasion in two BE-GIC lines in in vitro assays.
- RARRES2: RARRES2 is a chemoattractant that binds to Chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1). It is significantly up-regulated in BE-GICs compared to nBE-GICs, in both the authors' cohort and the HGCC cohort, and in non-G-CIMP tumour tissue relative to non-tumour brain tissue. High expression of RARRES2 is correlated with a worse prognosis. RARRES2 is well known to play a role in inflammation and promoting the migration of plasmacytoid DC, macrophages, and NK-cells. In scRNAseq data from Pombo Antunes et al., 2021, and Neftel et al., 2019, the receptor CMKLR1 is expressed in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) from newly diagnosed GBMs, particularly in non-hypoxic TAMs as compared to hypoxic TAMs in recurrent glioblastomas.
