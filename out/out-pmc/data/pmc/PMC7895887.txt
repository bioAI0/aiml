I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)

FAP is a cell surface protein that is highly expressed on cancer-associated fibroblasts, including those in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is also expressed in other cancer types, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer. FAP has been explored as a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with several studies investigating the use of FAP-specific PET imaging and FAP-targeted therapies in various cancers.

FGFR is a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that play a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. FGFR is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and has been implicated in the development and progression of this cancer type. FGFR has also been investigated as a potential target for immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with several studies exploring the use of FGFR inhibitors and FGFR-targeted therapies in glioblastoma and other cancers.

In addition to these antigens, the paper mentions the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
- Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
- Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)

These antigens are not specific to IDH-wildtype glioblastoma but are involved in immune checkpoint pathways that regulate T-cell activation and are being targeted in immunotherapy approaches for various cancers, including glioblastoma.
