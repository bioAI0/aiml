- HSPA5: HSPA5 is a key FRG that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is also upregulated in glioma tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and is positively correlated with CD274 expression. HSPA5 has been identified as a potential prognostic FRG for LGG patients, and its high expression levels have been confirmed in glioma cells.
- SLC1A5: SLC1A5 is another FRG that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is also upregulated in glioma tissues and positively correlated with CD274 expression. SLC1A5 has been identified as a potential prognostic FRG for LGG patients.
- NFE2L2: NFE2L2 is a FRG that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is upregulated in glioma tissues and positively correlated with CD274 expression. NFE2L2 has been identified as a potential prognostic FRG for LGG patients.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. The study suggests that the four prognostic FRGs, including HSPA5, SLC1A5, and NFE2L2, could be involved in tumor progression in LGG. The NEAT1/miR-124-3p/4 prognostic FRGs (LPCAT3, SLC1A5, HSPA5, and NFE2L2) axis was identified as a potential regulatory pathway in LGG. The study also highlights the potential of these antigens as therapeutic targets for LGG.
