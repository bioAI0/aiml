- **Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX)**: ATRX is a protein that plays a role in genomic stability and cell division. ATRX mutations cause genomic instability, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and alternate lengthening of telomeres (ALT), as well as increasing susceptibility to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Loss of nuclear ATRX expression due to ATRX gene mutation has been correlated with a survival benefit and is mainly seen in secondary GBM, IDH mutant. ATRX expression was found in 91.2% of patients in this study, with 8.8% showing loss of nuclear ATRX expression.

- **Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)**: EGFR plays a central role in cell proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, and angiogenesis, as well as influencing DNA repair and contributing to radio- and chemotherapy resistance. Amplification of the EGFR gene occurs in 30-50% of IDH-wildtype GBMs and is correlated with overexpression of EGFR protein. The most common mutated variant in GBM is tumor-specific EGFR splice variant III (EGFRvIII) which results from gene truncation and has been associated with worse survival prognosis and increased carcinogenicity. Current data concerning the survival correlation of EGFR are inconclusive, with some studies showing shorter survival and some studies showing no correlation with survival. A large meta-analysis concluded that most studies did not regard confounders and/or did not differentiate EGFR wildtype from EGFR mutations, so no clear statement could be made regarding EGFR status and survival prognosis. EGFRvIII expression was found in 40.9% of patients in this study, with a borderline significant correlation in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, which did not hold up in univariate and multivariate analysis.

- **Ki-67**: Ki-67 is a protein expressed exclusively in proliferating cells, with the Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) correlating closely with histological tumor grade in gliomas. A Ki-67 LI of 10% is regarded as a reliable criterion for malignancy. Although some studies see Ki-67 LI as a reliable predictor of survival with higher Ki-67 LI indicating worse prognosis, more reliable even than histologic grade or age, other studies could not find this association, possibly due to low reproducibility of Ki-67 LI detection between laboratories and examiners. Therefore, the role of Ki-67 LI as a prognostic factor is still disputed. A median Ki-67 LI of 20% is in line with the malignant nature and high proliferation of GBMs and averages approximately in between previously published data. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with lower Ki-67 LI < 20%, matching previous studies. The present study was able to show a tendency toward better overall survival in patients with a reduction of Ki-67 LI upon progression or recurrence, with statistical significance being reached for a median Ki-67 LI quotient of 2, but with significance being missed for both an absolute median reduction of 6% as well as for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of Ki-67 LI quotient â‰¤ 1 vs. > 1, which could be due to the small sample size. As mentioned above, the role of Ki-67 LI as a prognostic factor is still disputed due to differing results concerning its impact on survival. A previous study has discussed suboptimal methodological approaches as a possible factor in this variance. In the present study, the strength of the study lies firstly in the monocentric approach, seeing as Ki-67 LI detection took place at a single laboratory and with minimal examiner variance, and secondly in the inclusion of treatment criteria via analysis of the partial collective "favorable subgroup," making the significant results regarding Ki-67 LI and progression-free survival more reliable. Furthermore, the approach of integrating Ki-67 LI into the existing RPA score allows for the inclusion of further prognostic factors and could, in the authors' eyes, show that inclusion of Ki-67 LI can contribute to an improved assessment of survival. Concerning a possible impact of Ki-67 LI on treatment stratification, to the authors' knowledge, no data exist regarding glioblastoma, and this was also not the focus of the study. However, Ki-67 has been shown to impact treatment response in neuroendocrine neoplasms, prostate cancer, and metastatic lung carcinoids, as well as impacting treatment options for breast cancer. Such promising results in other malign entities combined with the prognostic value of Ki-67 LI as seen and discussed in the study emphasize the need for prospective trials to investigate a possible role of Ki-67 LI in stratification for treatment of glioblastoma.

- **O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT is involved in the repair of DNA strands by removing genotoxic alkyl groups from guanine. Methylation of the MGMT promoter reduces MGMT expression and thereby increases sensitivity to alkylating chemotherapy. Therefore, MGMT promoter methylation is consistently correlated with better survival when alkylating treatment has been performed. MGMT promoter methylation was more common in the study collective than expected, with 60% of patients having a methylated MGMT promoter compared to 40% in previously published data. A significantly better progression-free and overall survival in all collectives is in line with known data, with overall survival of 13 months for non-methylated and 18 months for methylated MGMT promoter coinciding with previous studies.
