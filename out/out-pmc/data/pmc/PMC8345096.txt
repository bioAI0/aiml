I have found the following information in the paper:

- IDH-wildtype glioblastoma: IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer that is characterized by the absence of mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes. This type of cancer is known to be more aggressive and have a worse prognosis than IDH-mutant glioblastoma.

- Antigens: The paper does not specifically mention any antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does discuss the use of advanced motor mapping techniques to identify two functional components of the primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with M1 gliomas. These techniques involve the use of high-frequency stimulation and the measurement of various neurophysiological parameters, such as motor threshold, MEP amplitude, and latency.

- Immunotherapy and tumor targeting: The paper does not discuss the use of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. However, it does mention the potential for the advanced motor mapping technique to be used as a tool to investigate M1 functional neuroplasticity, which could have implications for the development of new treatments for brain cancer.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or need additional information, please let me know.
