I have extracted the following information from the paper:

- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:** The paper does not explicitly mention any antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does discuss the use of radiomics and habitat imaging to identify distinct tumor areas or cell subpopulations, which can be important for determining prognosis and treatment response.

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:** The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of specific antigens across different cancer types.

- **Mentions of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:** The paper does not mention any specific antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, it does discuss the potential of radiomics and habitat imaging to identify aggressive subregions that are important for determining prognosis and treatment response.

As the paper does not contain the information you requested, I have not output anything.
