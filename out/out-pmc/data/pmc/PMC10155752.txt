- CD44: This antigen is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a broad range of expression levels. It is associated with poor prognosis and plays a critical role in GBM invasion and migration.
- GFAP: GFAP shows differential RNA expression in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a lower average and wider range of SNR compared to other pathologies. This difference in expression is maintained at the protein level, and GFAP is known to positively correlate with advancing neuroglial tumor grade.
- S100B: S100B is expressed at lower levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a decrease of at least 2-fold in all AOIs compared to other pathologies. Higher expression levels of S100B in patients with GBM are associated with shorter overall survival.
- MBP: MBP is expressed at significantly lower levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with an average expression at least 64 times lower in all AOIs compared to other pathologies. It has been suggested as a potential biomarker for various types of tumors, including glioblastoma, and may play a role in the progression and potential treatment of multiple sclerosis.
- GSK3β: GSK3β is part of the PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway, and its phosphorylation state plays a role in glycogen synthesis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell cycle. In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, protein expression levels of phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) are broad and at least 2-fold higher for several AOIs compared to other pathologies.
- Phospho-Tau: Phosphorylated Tau variants, such as pSer199, pThr231, and pSer404, show differential expression in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Phospho-Thr231 Tau is at least 2-fold higher for several AOIs in the GBM sample compared to IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Tau, pSer199 Tau, and pSer404 Tau are only expressed at higher levels in GBM than IDH-wildtype glioblastoma within the GFAP-enriched AOIs.
