- CD44: This antigen is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, and its expression is critical for GBM invasion and migration. Higher levels of CD44 have been associated with poor prognosis in GBM.
- GFAP: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a marker of astrocytic differentiation and is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Its expression is positively correlated with advancing neuroglial tumor grade.
- S100B: S100B is a calcium-binding protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It has been shown to promote glioma growth and increase myeloid-derived macrophage chemoattraction.
- GSK3β: This protein is part of the PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway and is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Its phosphorylation state plays a role in glycogen synthesis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell cycle regulation.
- Tau: Microtubule-associated protein tau is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with the resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cell lines. It has also been linked to glioblastoma progression, 3D cell organization, growth, and migration.

These antigens are not only highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma but also have implications for immunotherapy and tumor targeting. For example, CD44 has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in GBM, and S100B has been shown to promote glioma growth and increase myeloid-derived macrophage chemoattraction. Additionally, GSK3β and Tau have been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell signaling, gene expression, and cell growth and differentiation, which are critical for tumor development and immune response.
