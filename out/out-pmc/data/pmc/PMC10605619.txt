The paper does not provide specific information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens and their expression in various cancer types:

- **Lomustine**: A non-selective alkylating agent that induces the crosslinking of DNA/RNA in dividing cells, leading to cell apoptosis. It is used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.
- **Carmustine**: Binds to and alters the activity of glutathione reductase, and is used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.
- **Carmustine wafer implants**: Similar to carmustine, these implants bind to and alter the activity of glutathione reductase. They are used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.
- **Temozolomide (TMZ)**: A non-specific alkylating agent that activates mismatch repair in DNA through methylation at the O6 position of guanine. It is used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.
- **Bevacizumab (BVZ)**: A targeted healing antibody that attaches to and hinders the activity of the VEGF protein within tumor cells. It is used in the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers.

The paper does not provide specific information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
