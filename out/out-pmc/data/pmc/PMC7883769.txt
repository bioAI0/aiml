I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on radiogenomic modeling and the prediction of survival-associated prognostic groups in glioblastoma, without discussing antigens or their expression levels.
