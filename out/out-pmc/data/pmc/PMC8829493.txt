- GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein): This antigen is mentioned in the context of immunohistochemical studies, where it shows positive expression in the glial component of gliosarcoma and negative expression in the mesenchymal component.

- p53: The text describes p53 as being positive in both the glial and mesenchymal components of the tumor.

- IDH1 and IDH2: These antigens are mentioned in the context of genetic profiling, where the lack of mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 genes is noted, confirming the diagnosis of mesenchymal glioblastoma.

- MGMT (O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase): The absence of MGMT methylation is mentioned as part of the genetic profile of the tumor.

- EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor): The text mentions the absence of EGFR amplification in the genetic profile of the tumor.

- Chromosome 7 and 10: The article discusses the gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 as part of the genetic characteristics of the tumor.

The paper does not provide specific information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
