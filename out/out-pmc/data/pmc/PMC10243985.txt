I'm sorry, but I could not find any information in the provided text regarding antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, their expression levels across different cancer types, or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting. The text focuses on the treatment of unmethylated MGMT-promoter recurrent glioblastoma using a cancer stem cell assay-guided chemotherapy approach, and does not discuss antigens or their expression levels in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
