I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on the development of an automated method for identifying genetic alterations in glioblastomas using imaging data, and does not discuss antigens or their expression levels.
