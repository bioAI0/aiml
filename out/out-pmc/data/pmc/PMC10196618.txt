I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR: The article mentions that IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma with EGFR amplification, combined whole chromosome 7 gain and whole chromosome 10 loss (+7/âˆ’10) or TERT promoter mutation, resembles IDH-wildtype glioblastoma in the aggressive clinical course.
- CDKN2A/B: The study found that CDKN2A/B alterations were common in adult patients with pediatric-type diffuse gliomas, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- PIK3CA: PIK3CA alterations were also frequently observed in these patients.
- PTEN: PTEN alterations were another common molecular feature in this patient group.

Regarding expression levels across different cancer types, the article does not provide specific information on the expression of these antigens in various cancer types. However, it does mention that IDH-wildtype glioblastoma exhibits an aggressive clinical course, which may suggest higher expression levels of these antigens compared to other cancer types.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the article does not explicitly discuss the use of these antigens for immunotherapy or tumor targeting in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. However, the identification of these molecular alterations in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma could potentially inform the development of targeted therapies or immunotherapeutic approaches for this specific cancer type.
