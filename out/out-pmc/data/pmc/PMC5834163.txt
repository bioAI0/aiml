I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Nestin
- Sox2
- Vimentin

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry, which are techniques used to visualize the expression of specific proteins in cells and tissues. The paper describes the use of these techniques to confirm the expression of Nestin, Sox2, and Vimentin in patient-derived cell lines and orthotopic implantation models.

The paper does not provide information about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their potential use in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
