I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
- Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
- Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
- c-Met receptor
- Transcription factor FOXO3
- Sonic hedgehog pathway

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting. For example, the article discusses the use of TERT-specific small-molecule inhibitors, immunotherapy, gene therapy, and plant-derived compounds to target telomerase as a therapeutic strategy. The authors also mention the potential of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to silence mutated oncogenes in SVZ NSCs, which could be a promising approach for GBM therapy.

The article does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
