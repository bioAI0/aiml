- CD14 and CD64: These antigens are expressed at higher levels on microglia in IDH-wildtype GBM compared to IDH-mutant tumors.
- HLA-DR and MHC I/II: These antigens are expressed at higher levels on macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM compared to IDH-mutant tumors.
- CD163 and CX3CR1: These antigens are expressed on a subset of macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM, and their expression is associated with immunosuppressive functions.
- CADM1: This antigen is expressed on macrophages in IDH-wildtype GBM, and its expression is associated with immunosuppressive functions.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting in GBM. For example, the article discusses the potential of targeting CD163+ macrophages with anti-CD163 antibodies as a therapeutic strategy. Additionally, the article mentions that CD163 and CX3CR1 are potential targets for immunotherapy in GBM, as they are associated with immunosuppressive functions.
