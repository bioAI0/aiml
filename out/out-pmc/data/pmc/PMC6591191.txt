- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor): EGFR is mutated or amplified in 35–45% of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and is implicated as a key driver. However, gliosarcoma, a histologic variant of glioblastoma, does not exhibit amplification or mutations of EGFR at the same frequency, suggesting there may be additional/alternate mechanisms propelling tumorigenesis and potentially mesenchymal transition into a sarcoma phenotype. The study found that EGFR amplification is uncommon in gliosarcoma, but frequent gain of chromosome 7 (72%) containing the EGFR locus was observed. It is important to note that amplification or mutation of EGFR is not necessarily required for EGFR activation. For example, copy number gain of SYNJ2 in breast cancer leads to EGFR activation by altered trafficking pathways. Therefore, even though EGFR amplification is not common in gliosarcoma, EGFR pathway activation may still be present.

Aberrant activation of NF-kß in glioblastoma has been reported, leading to cell invasive capabilities, resistance to radiotherapy, and even promotion of mesenchymal phenotype. Studies have been published to evaluate the therapeutic effect of inhibition of NF-kß based on these mechanisms. The study found that there is copy number loss in the region encoding for NF-kß in gliosarcoma, implying that activation of the NF-kß pathway does not play a role in gliosarcoma genesis. However, it is possible that loss of NF-kß could lead to loss of DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in neoplasia.
