I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR: EGFR amplification is more prevalent in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, particularly in the NT-2 cluster, compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. EGFR is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies in various cancers, including glioblastoma.
- CDKN2A/B: These genes are frequently deleted in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, especially in the NT-2 cluster. CDKN2A/B deletions have been implicated in tumorigenesis and are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
- TERT promoter mutation: The TERT promoter mutation is more common in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, particularly in the NT-2 cluster, compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. TERT promoter mutations have been associated with tumor progression and are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and their expression levels are compared across different glioma subtypes. While the paper does not provide detailed information on their expression across different cancer types, it highlights their relevance in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting for glioblastoma.
