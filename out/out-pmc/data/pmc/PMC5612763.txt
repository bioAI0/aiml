The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- EGFR: The paper discusses EGFR amplification and its association with higher ZEB1 labelling index in glioblastoma. EGFR is a well-known target for immunotherapy in various cancer types, including glioblastoma.
- IDH1: The study investigates the relationship between IDH1 mutation status and ZEB1 expression, suggesting that IDH1-mutant lower-grade gliomas have higher ZEB1 expression. IDH1 has been explored as a potential target for immunotherapy in gliomas.
- PDGFRA, Wnt, and TGF-beta: These signaling pathways are mentioned as regulators of ZEB1 expression in glioblastoma. Targeting these pathways has been proposed as a potential strategy for glioblastoma treatment.

While the paper does not provide specific expression levels for these antigens across different cancer types, it highlights their involvement in glioblastoma biology and their potential as therapeutic targets.
