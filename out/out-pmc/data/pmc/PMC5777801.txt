The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention HOXD4 as an antigen that is overexpressed in glioma tissues compared to normal brain tissues. The study found that HOXD4 expression was significantly higher in WHO grade IV gliomas (glioblastoma) than in grade III gliomas, and that high HOXD4 expression was associated with shorter survival in glioblastoma patients.

The paper also discusses the potential of HOXD4 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma, but it does not provide information on the expression levels of HOXD4 across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
