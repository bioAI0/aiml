- MET: The MET pathway can increase levels of VEGFA and VEGFR2 on endothelial cells and promote proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Activation of the HGF/MET axis prevents apoptosis through activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 kinase) and subsequent AKT activation. Upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in GBM leads to the growth and survival of uncontrolled tumor cells through the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) that activates many cell survival and anti-apoptotic genes. Another dysregulated pathway is RAS. By activating this pathway, MET can induce other signaling pathways such as MAPK, allowing tumor cells to grow and survive. Upregulation of RTKs such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can affect multiple signaling pathways in GBM. It has been found that STAT3 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) have a role in the promotion of GBM cell invasion and migration.
- VEGFA: VEGFA is a key signaling pathway in medulloblastoma, as it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Activation of the pathway has widespread and multi-functional tumor-promoting effects. HGF-activated MET paracrine signaling on endothelial cells can enhance their angiogenic activity. In the context of medulloblastoma, MET activation leads to the expression of proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factor, which are known for their important roles in tumor promotion through angiogenesis.
- VEGFR2: Aberrant expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- PDGFRβ: Aberrant expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- ErbB1-4: Aberrant expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB1-4) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- HGF: HGF is a key tumor-promoting factor in the tumor microenvironment. It has been found to be overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its expression often correlates with the malignancy grade of gliomas. The aberrant expression of MET in high-grade gliomas and embryonal brain tumors is associated with poor clinical outcomes. HGF binds to the receptor MET and induces several biological activities involved in cancer progression, such as growth, survival, motility, and metastasis.
