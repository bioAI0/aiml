I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- S100A8
- S100A9
- MMP9
- CXCR1

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as novel biomarkers for glioblastoma. The paper also highlights the role of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment and their association with angiogenesis, immune response, and tumor progression.

Here is the relevant information extracted from the paper:

- S100A8 and S100A9: These proteins are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells and are associated with poor prognosis. They are involved in maintaining tumor angiogenesis and promoting malignant progression.

- MMP9: This protein is associated with the pathological grading of gliomas and predicts poor prognosis. Patients with lower MMP9 expression are more likely to benefit from TMZ treatment, regardless of MGMT-methylation status.

- CXCR1: This chemokine receptor is significantly overexpressed in patients with glioma compared to normal individuals. It is involved in promoting neutrophil maturation, survival, and recruitment, and is associated with tumor-promoting activity.

The paper also mentions the potential of using these antigens as targets for immunotherapy, but does not provide specific details on their expression levels across different cancer types.
