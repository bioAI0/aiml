- Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR): EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently amplified and overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is associated with poor prognosis and is a potential target for immunotherapy. The EGFR-inhibitor/tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib has shown minimal effectiveness in more common isoforms that overexpress EGFR and PTEN.
- p53: p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is often mutated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Mutations in p53 can lead to increased cell proliferation and resistance to therapy.
- Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PI3KCA): PI3KCA is a component of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which is frequently altered in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. This pathway is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Mutations in PI3KCA can lead to increased signaling and tumor growth.
- Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 1 (PI3KR1): PI3KR1 is another component of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, and its mutations are associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- CDK4, CDK4/MDM2, CDKN2A, 19+/20+, and MGMT: These genes are also associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Alterations in these genes can contribute to tumor growth and resistance to therapy.

The article does not provide specific expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it mentions that IDH-wildtype glioblastoma demonstrates a complex molecular profile involving these alterations, which contribute to unchecked cell growth, enhanced cell survival, and the aggressive nature of the tumor.
