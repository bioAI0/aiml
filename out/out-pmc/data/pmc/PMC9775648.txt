- **Fibronectin 1 (FN1)**: FN1 is a prognostic risk factor and is significantly upregulated in GBM samples. It may play a role in GBM progression through ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.
- **HLA-DRA, CD44, SLC1A5, EGFR, ITGB2, PTPRJ**: These genes were found to be significantly upregulated in GBM. High expression of CD44, PTPRJ, and HLA-DRA was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival.
- **IL-13Ra2**: IL-13Ra2 is an interleukin receptor that is overexpressed in over 60% of GBM and 44.1% of gliomas. Clinical trials have found immunotherapies targeting the IL-13Ra2 receptor to be effective.
- **CD133/CD44**: CD133 is co-expressed with CD44 and linked to similar molecular features.
- **B7-H3**: B7-H3 is a marker for SVZ-GBM cells and its inhibition in GBM cells reduces their tumorigenicity. Out of the two B7-H3 isoforms, only 2IgB7-H3 was detected in non-cancerous brain tissue, whereas 4IgB7-H3 was specific to GBM. 2IgB7-H3 expression was higher in GBM recurrences and increased resistance to temozolomide-mediated apoptosis.
