- EGFR: The study found that EGFR alterations were detected in 28.2% of patients with IDH wild-type GBM. EGFR alterations were associated with cortical lesions, favorable removal rates, and low Ki-67 scores. The authors suggest that EGFR alteration is an important marker for different localizations and clinical courses in GBM.
- PDGFRA: PDGFRA alterations were detected in 22.6% of patients with IDH wild-type GBM. PDGFRA alteration was associated with high proliferative potential and multiple lesions. The study found that PDGFRA alteration had a significant relationship with poor removal and survival rates.
- TERTp: TERTp mutations were observed in 66.9% of the patients. The study found that TERTp mutation was more common in the multiple GBM group than in the solitary GBM group, although the difference was not statistically significant.
- PTEN: PTEN loss was observed in 50% of the patients. The study found that PTEN loss was significantly associated with cortical lesions and was more common in group III, which was thought to have originated from the cortex.
- RB1: RB1 alterations were present in 41.9% of the patients. The study found that RB1 wild type was strongly correlated with multiple GBMs.
- TP53: TP53 alterations were found in 48.4% of the patients. The study did not find any significant differences in TP53 alteration between the SVZ and non-SVZ groups or between solitary and multiple GBMs.
- CDK4: CDK4 amplifications were observed in 18.5% of the patients. The study found that CDK4 amplification was more common in periventricular lesions (group II), which may reflect the characteristics of NPC-like GBM and tumor localization.
- CDK6: CDK6 amplifications were found in 2.4% of the patients. The study did not find any significant differences in CDK6 amplification between the SVZ and non-SVZ groups or between solitary and multiple GBMs.
- CDKN2A/2B: CDKN2A/2B homozygous deletions were present in 46% of the patients. The study found that CDKN2A/2B homozygous deletions were more common in group I, which touched the SVZ and cortex, and in multiple GBMs.
- MGMTp: MGMTp methylation was observed in 67.7% of the patients. The study found that MGMTp methylation was more common in group I, which touched the SVZ and cortex, and in multiple GBMs.

The study did not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
