- **EGFR**: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well-known oncogene that is frequently mutated in various cancers, including glioblastoma. In the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, EGFR alterations are common, and the gene is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to control tissues. However, the expression of EGFR does not seem to be significantly different between TP53 mutant and wildtype IDH-wildtype glioblastoma tumorspheres (TSs).

- **TERT**: The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene is associated with telomerase activity, which is crucial for cancer cell immortality. TERT promoter mutations are prevalent in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and the gene is overexpressed in tumor tissues, especially in recurrent tumors. TERT and TP53 are positively correlated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma tissues and TSs, and this association is also observed in other tumor types and normal brain tissue.

- **PTEN**: The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in various cancers. In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, PTEN is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to control tissues, and this trend is reflected in TSs. However, there is no significant difference in PTEN expression between TP53 mutant and wildtype TSs.

- **IDH1**: The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene is a key enzyme in cellular metabolism, and its mutation is a defining feature of IDH-mutant glioblastoma. In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, IDH1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to control tissues, but there is no significant difference in expression between TP53 mutant and wildtype TSs.

- **PTPRZ1**: The protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTPRZ1) gene is associated with the origin of glioma cells and is overexpressed in GBM tissues and TSs. Its expression is elevated in the subventricular zone, suggesting a role in neuroglial development and tumorigenesis. PTPRZ1 is relatively less mutated in GBM compared to other genes, but its expression is associated with the molecular characteristics of the tumor.

- **MGMT**: The O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is involved in DNA repair and is often methylated in glioblastoma, leading to reduced gene expression and increased sensitivity to alkylating agents like temozolomide. MGMT promoter methylation status is associated with gene expression, and unmethylated MGMT promoter status is linked to poor response to alkylating agents in GBM.

- **TP53**: The tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene is a well-known tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in various cancers, including glioblastoma. In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, TP53 mutations are common, and TP53 mutant TSs are more amenable to isolation from tissue. TP53 mutants overexpress ECM-related genes and are associated with more mesenchymal subtypes. However, the association between TP53 mutation status and TS isolation rate is not well established.

- **NEAT1**: The nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is a long non-coding RNA that is overexpressed in the driver-enriched cluster of a GBM TS. NEAT1 distinguishes the survival of patients with GBM and lower-grade gliomas, and its expression is elevated in TP53 wildtype GBM tissues. However, the association between TP53 and NEAT1 requires further investigation.

- **MALAT1**: The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a long non-coding RNA that is correlated with NEAT1 in single-cell RNA sequencing of GBM TSs.

- **IGFBP5**: Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) is a protein that is commonly upregulated in GBM compared to cortical tissues. It has been studied as an important factor in GBM and gliomas, and its expression is relatively stable after TMZ treatment.

- **CDKN1A**: The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) gene encodes a protein that is associated with cell cycle regulation and is induced by p53 in response to DNA damage. CDKN1A is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype GBM tissues compared to control tissues, and its expression is elevated in TP53 mutant TSs.

- **KIF20A**: The kinesin family member 20A (KIF20A) gene encodes a protein involved in cell division and is downregulated after TMZ treatment in GBM TSs.

- **BAX**: The BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) gene is a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL2 family and is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype GBM tissues compared to control tissues. However, there is no significant difference in BAX expression between TP53 mutant and wildtype TSs.

- **MIR34AHG**: The MIR34AHG gene is a microRNA host gene that is overexpressed in IDH-wildtype GBM tissues compared to control tissues. However, there is no significant difference in MIR34AHG expression between TP53 mutant and wildtype TSs.

- **NOTCH pathway genes**: Genes related to the NOTCH signaling pathway, such as NOTCH1, HES1, and HEY1, are differentially expressed in GBM TSs, with higher expression in TP53 mutant TSs.

- **Neurotransmitter-related genes**: Genes associated with neurotransmission, such as SLC17A7, SLC18A2, and SLC6A1, are differentially expressed in GBM TSs, with higher expression in TP53 mutant TSs.

- **Glioma type-related genes**: Genes associated with glioma subtypes, such as GFAP, OLIG2, and SOX2, are differentially expressed in GBM TSs, with higher expression in TP53 mutant TSs.

- **ECM-related genes**: Genes related to the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as COL1A1, COL1A2, and FN1, are overexpressed in TP53 mutant TSs and are associated with mesenchymal subtypes of GBM.

- **EMT-related genes**: Genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as CDH1, VIM, and SNAI2, are differentially expressed in GBM TSs, but there is no definite association with TP53 mutation status.

- **Glioma sphere-related genes**: Genes associated with glioma sphere formation, such as CD44, CD133, and SOX2, are differentially expressed in GBM TSs, with higher expression in TP53 mutant TSs.

- **Invasion-related genes**: Genes associated with invasion, such as MMP2, MMP9, and TIMP1, are differentially expressed in GBM TSs, but there is no definite association with TP53 mutation status.

- **Cancer-related long non-coding RNAs**: Several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are differentially expressed in GBM TSs and are associated with cancer progression. These include MALAT1, NEAT1, HOTAIR, XIST, and MEG3.

Regarding immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper does not provide specific information on the use of these antigens as targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies. However, the expression patterns and associations of these antigens with molecular characteristics and clinical outcomes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma suggest that they could be potential targets for therapeutic intervention or biomarkers for disease monitoring.
