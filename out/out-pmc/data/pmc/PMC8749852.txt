- **VEGF-A**: This antigen is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is a key player in the angiogenesis process. It is also implicated in the mobilization of endothelial precursor cells and is associated with the histological grade of the tumor. VEGF-A is upregulated in the pseudopalized necrotic region of glioblastoma, primarily driven by the HIF family.

- **VEGFR2**: VEGFR2 is the main receptor mediating the physiological and pathological effects of VEGF, favoring the survival and proliferation of GECs. It is also involved in the vascular normalization process, which leads to an increase in tumor perfusion and oxygenation.

- **Angiopoietin 1 and 2**: These proteins bind to the Tie2 receptor with opposite effects. Angiopoietin 1 activates it, while angiopoietin 2 inhibits it. The activation results in vascular stabilization and permeability decrease, which are vital processes for vessel development in the sane patient. Angiopoietin 2 is particularly overexpressed in glioblastoma and favors the formation of immature vessels at the beginning of angiogenesis. It also has a pro-inflammatory activity that leads to the recruitment of myeloid cells, which are involved in neovascularization and the formation of perivascular and hypoxic niches.

- **DLL4**: This molecule is present in glioblastoma but not in glioma cells, demonstrating the importance of the neo-angiogenic activity in these grade IV tumors. DLL4 is involved in the differentiation of the precursor of the ECs, which can become either a tip cell or a stalk cell. It causes the overexpression of the adjacent Notch receptors, leading to the differentiation into stalk cells due to the interaction with VEGF-A.

- **Notch 1 and 4**: These receptors are recognized on the EC membrane and are vital in determining differentiative pathways of the precursor of the ECs. Notch, together with VEGF, is essential in determining differentiative pathways of the precursor of the ECs, which can become either a tip cell or a stalk cell.

- **YAP-Hippo axis**: This pathway is involved in the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), a vital process for neoplastic cells to develop an invasive phenotype. Metformin suppresses this axis, leading to a decrease in EMT markers in GSCs and the suppression of both mRNA and protein levels of Vimentin in favor of E-Cadherin. The molecular effect is on the YAP-Hippo axis, which induces EMT. By phosphorylating YAP, metformin prevents it from moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and avoids its activity as a transcription modulator in gliomas, thus lowering the activity of all the downstream molecules and decreasing its pro-EMT activity.

- **CLIC1**: This protein shows a functional expression, meaning that it is expressed only when it must act to allow the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. The transient activation of the channel allows metformin to bind the Arg29 domain (on the outer layer of the membrane), stabilizing the close state or obstructing the channel. Analysis on mRNA revealed a correlation between glioblastoma malignancy and expression of CLIC1. In detail, this correlation is present in both human glioblastoma and experimental models. However, because the downstream pathway of the channel is not known yet, it is not clear what is the purpose of these metformin effects, and more studies should be conducted to deepen the investigation.

- **CD133**: This marker is used in in vitro models to recognize GSCs, but it is well known that, because of the plasticity of these cells, these markers are not always expressed. Metformin treatment demonstrated a reduction of cell growth only in CD133+ compared to CD133- and a lack of proliferation in human stem cell.

- **IGF-receptor**: The food uptake determines the increased liver cell expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), IGF-receptor, and insulin-receptor. This, in turn, leads to the activation of a signal transduction starting from the insulin receptor substrate (IRS), involving the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt (PKB, protein kinase B) and inactivating the TSC Complex Subunit 2 (TSC2), known as a tumor suppressor. The activation of mTOR as an indirect result of the signal transduction inhibits TSC2 and promotes cell growth and proliferation. Several studies reported that cancer risk and progression are associated with mTOR activation. Therefore, it is plausible that metformin's anti-cancer effects are associated with the inhibition of mTOR activity.
