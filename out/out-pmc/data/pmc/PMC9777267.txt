- IDH1 R132H: This marker is examined for reactivity (positive or negative) and the cytoplasmic intensity of the reaction (strong, moderate, or weak).
- Nestin: This marker is evaluated by the cytoplasmic immunoreaction (strong, moderate, or weak) of glial cells and reactivity (positive or negative) in endothelial cells. It is expressed in neural stem cells, cancer stem cells, and undifferentiated cancer cells. In some tumors, such as cerebral ones, its overexpression correlates with tumor grade and invasiveness and indicates cellular immaturity.
- Ki-67: The reference index for this marker is calculated as the percentage of positive nuclei after counting on 10 HPF of at least 1000 nuclei.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, and their expression levels are assessed using immunohistochemical methods. The study also discusses the importance of these antigens in the prognosis and survival of patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
