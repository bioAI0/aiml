I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR
- MDM4
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as targets for treatment. For example, the paper states that "EGFR-mutated IDHwt gliomas were suggestively enriched in the later-onset cohort," and that "CDKN2A methylation was also significantly associated with later-onset LIHC (FDR = 1.40E-5) and SKCM (FDR = 0.017), and suggestively associated with later-onset THCA (FDR = 0.057) and BRCA (FDR = 0.069)."

The paper also provides information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. For example, it states that "EGFR-mutated IDHwt (FDR = 7.03E-10) and IDH1-mutated IDHmut-codel gliomas (FDR = 0.020) were both significantly enriched in later-onset cases," and that "CDK2NA methylation was also significantly associated with later-onset LIHC (FDR = 1.40E-5) and SKCM (FDR = 0.017), and suggestively associated with later-onset THCA (FDR = 0.057) and BRCA (FDR = 0.069)."

Overall, the paper highlights the potential of these antigens as targets for immunotherapy and tumor targeting in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, and provides valuable insights into their expression levels across different cancer types.
