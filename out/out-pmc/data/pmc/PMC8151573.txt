- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- FAP is a member of the dipeptidyl peptidase family, which has catalytic activity and is engaged in protein recruitment and scaffolds.
- Recent studies have found that FAP expression in different types of cells within the GBM microenvironment is typically upregulated compared with that in lower grade glioma and is most pronounced in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM.
- As a marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with tumorigenic activity, FAP has been proven to promote tumor growth and invasion via hydrolysis of molecules such as brevican in the extracellular matrix and targeting of downstream pathways and substrates, such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21).
- In addition, based on its ability to suppress antitumor immunity in GBM and induce temozolomide resistance, FAP may be a potential target for immunotherapy and reversing temozolomide resistance; however, current studies on therapies targeting FAP are still limited.
- In this review, the authors summarized recent progress in FAP expression profiling and the understanding of the biological function of FAP in GBM and raised the possibility of FAP as an imaging biomarker and therapeutic target.
- They found that FAP is expressed in various cell types within the GBM microenvironment, including GBM cells, stromal mesenchymal cells, pericytes, and GBM-derived endothelial cells.
- FAP plays a protumorigenic role in GBM and other solid tumors, and its enzymatic and nonenzymatic activity has been investigated in other solid tumors, suggesting possible exploration directions for FAP in GBM.
- Several substrates of FAP have been identified, including collagen I and III, FGFR21, and NPY, and the functional roles of FAP enzymatic activity have also been investigated.
- Via enzymatic cleavage of its substrates, FAP plays an important role in extracellular matrix modulation, infiltrated macrophage education, metabolic regulation, and tumor promotion; therefore, inhibiting the enzymatic activity of FAP may be a potential strategy of antitumor therapy.
- In GBM, several of the mentioned substrates were investigated, and possible functional roles of FAP in GBM were also proposed.
- The authors discussed the current knowledge of FAP roles in GBM, including tumor proliferation and invasion, angiogenesis, immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, EMT, and TMZ resistance.
- They also explored the future clinical applications of FAP, including FAP as a potential imaging biomarker, prognostic value of FAP, and advances in FAP-targeted therapy.
- The authors concluded that current studies have discovered upregulated FAP expression in GBM and proposed potential roles of FAP in GBM which are not yet well characterized in GBM; however, preclinical studies have shown the potential of FAP in clinical practice, while more investigation is needed to fulfill our understanding of FAP functional roles and overcome the challenges we are facing to improve FAP targeted therapy in GBM.
