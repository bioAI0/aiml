I'm sorry, I could not find any information in the text about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The paper focuses on TERTp mutations in gliomas and their detection using the TERTmonitor qPCR assay, but it does not provide details about antigen expression or immunotherapy.
