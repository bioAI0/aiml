I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- IDH1 R132H
- Ki-67
- Nestin

These antigens were used as immunohistochemical markers in the study, and their expression was evaluated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and IDH-mutant astrocytoma samples. The study did not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.

The study did not mention these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, it is worth noting that the authors discussed the potential role of IDH1 mutations in therapeutic management, highlighting ongoing clinical trials with chemotherapeutics and targeted vaccines targeting the IDH1 mutation.
