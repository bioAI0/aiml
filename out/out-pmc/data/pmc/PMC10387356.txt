The paper does not provide specific information about antigens highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it mentions the use of anti-EpCAM antibodies for detecting or enriching circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream. EpCAM (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule) is a cell surface protein that is often overexpressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma. The paper also discusses the challenges in detecting CTCs in malignant astrocytoma due to the absence of EpCAM expression in glioma cells, which is a crucial consideration for immunotherapy and tumor targeting strategies.
