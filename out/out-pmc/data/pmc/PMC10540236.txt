- **IGF2R**: Overexpressed in GBM samples compared with normal brain specimens, but no association between its expression and patientsâ€™ outcomes was observed.
- **S100A4**: Necessary for maintaining glioblastoma stem cells self-renewal; ablation of S100A4-expressing cancer cells is sufficient to impede glioma growth in vivo.
- **CCL2**: Increased in mesenchymal GBM and recruits MDSCs.
- **CCL3**: Probably responsible for chemotaxis and is expressed in activated microglia cells that stimulate glioma progression and development.
- **IRF8**: Contributes to immune evasion.
- **APOC1**: Promotes GBM tumorigenesis and is involved in lipid metabolism or immunosuppression.
- **SPP1**: A marker of glioma-associated macrophages that ensures immunosuppression and worsens survival.
- **IL10**: A driver force of tumor immune escape; this interleukin is released by a subset of myeloid cells localized in mesenchymal-like tumor regions.
- **NF1**: Loss of NF1 was found to be correlated with increased immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment and may prime cells for malignant transformation.
