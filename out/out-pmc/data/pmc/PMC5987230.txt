- Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): This antigen is strongly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as demonstrated by the case study presented in the paper. GFAP is a protein specific to astrocytes and other glial cells, and its expression is often used as a marker for these cell types. The paper mentions that the neoplastic cells in the case study showed diffuse reactivity for GFAP, confirming their glial-astrocytic origin.

- S-100 protein: S-100 protein is another antigen with strong expression in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as evidenced by the case study. S-100 proteins are a family of low-molecular-weight proteins found in various tissues, including the brain, and are often used as markers for neural tissue. The paper notes that neoplastic cells exhibited diffuse reactivity for S-100 protein, further supporting their glial origin.

- Ki-67: Ki-67 is a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation, and its expression is often used as a marker for tumor aggressiveness. In the case study, the Ki-67 proliferative index was markedly elevated, indicating a high-grade, aggressive lesion. While the paper does not explicitly state that Ki-67 is an antigen, it is commonly used as a target for immunohistochemistry and may be considered an antigen in this context.

- BRAF V600E: The BRAF V600E mutation is a specific genetic alteration that results in the expression of a mutated BRAF protein. Approximately 50% of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas harbour this mutation, and it is also observed in some melanomas. The paper discusses the potential therapeutic implications of BRAF inhibitors for tumors with this mutation, suggesting that BRAF V600E could be a target for immunotherapy or tumor-targeted therapy.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting beyond the potential implications of the BRAF V600E mutation.
