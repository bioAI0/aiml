- **FHOD1 (formin homology domain containing protein 1)**: FHOD1 is frequently expressed in glioblastoma tissue, with moderate/high expression in 84% of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cases. The expression of FHOD1 is not uniform, and can be higher in infiltrating cells than in the tumor bulk. The study suggests that the moderate/high expression of FHOD1 in a subset of glioblastomas can be considered as overexpression, as it is not expressed in brain parenchyma, although it is present in endothelial cells in the brain. However, not all glioblastomas express immunohistochemically detectable amounts of FHOD1, indicating that its expression is not crucial for glioblastoma invasion. FHOD1 has been found to be upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, and participates in migration/invasion in vitro.

- **INF2 (inverted formin 2)**: INF2 is frequently expressed in glioblastoma tissue, with moderate/high expression in 46% of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cases. The expression of INF2 is not uniform, and can be higher in infiltrating cells than in the tumor bulk. The study suggests that the moderate/high expression of INF2 in a subset of glioblastomas can be considered as overexpression, as it is expressed at low levels in glial cells according to the human protein atlas. However, not all glioblastomas express immunohistochemically detectable amounts of INF2, indicating that its expression is not crucial for glioblastoma invasion. INF2 has been found to be upregulated in basal-like breast cancer, and is associated with basal markers and functional activities.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
