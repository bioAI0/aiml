- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- IDH-wildtype glioblastomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.
- FAP is highly expressed in the stroma surrounding more than 90% of epithelial-derived tumors and their metastases and is consistently expressed in bone and soft tissue tumor cells.
- FAP is one of the specific markers of CAFs in TME and is closely related to tumor invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and prognosis and is considered an essential target for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.
- FAP is highly expressed on the cell surface of high-grade gliomas (excluding diffuse astrocytomas).
- Clinical studies have shown high uptake of FAPI imaging agents in high-grade gliomas (SUVmax = 2.8 ± 0.6), whereas low-grade gliomas showed only mild uptake (SUVmax = 0.35 ± 0.10).
- FAP imaging agents may be helpful in the detection and target area sketching of high-grade gliomas in the brain, non-invasive grading of gliomas, and assessment of prognosis after radiotherapy.
