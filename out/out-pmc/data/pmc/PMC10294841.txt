I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- E-cadherin
- N-cadherin
- Vimentin
- ZEB1
- Snail
- Twist
- Notch

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. For example, the paper discusses the potential of developing lncRNAs as reliable GBM genetic biomarkers and the need for further research on tumour-suppressive lncRNAs as potential molecular targets in the EMT-like process in GBM.

The paper also mentions that the expression of E- and N-cadherins is investigated in almost all studies as an indication of GBM MES transition, and that developing a genomic profile for gliomas would provide a more accurate and indicative alternative to the current cadherin solution for the detection of an EMT-like process.

In addition, the paper discusses the role of transcription factors in regulating the expression and activity of EMT transcription factors (ZEB1, Slug, Snail, Twist1) which modulate the expression of the typical EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) and concomitantly induce MES transition in GBM.

The paper also highlights the importance of further validation studies to confirm the direct relation and crosstalk among factors in the signalling involved, as well as the need for more suitable pre-clinical models to elucidate these regulatory mechanisms relevant to the clinical settings.
