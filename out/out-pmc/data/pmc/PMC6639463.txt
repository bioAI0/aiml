- **Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2)**: IGFBP2 is a protein that binds to and regulates the activity of insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II. It is frequently overexpressed in glioblastomas and is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor survival. The text highlights that IGFBP2-driven tumors are dependent on the continued expression of IGFBP2, and its knockdown leads to decreased tumor progression and prolonged survival. IGFBP2 is also overexpressed in the stem cell compartment of glioblastomas, contributing to tumor progression by enriching for glioma stem cells and boosting their survival. The article suggests that IGFBP2 could be a potential therapeutic target, and neutralizing antibodies against IGFBP2 have been shown to impair oncogenic signaling pathways and inhibit tumor cell spread.

- **Platelet-derived growth factor Î² (PDGFB)**: The text mentions that IGFBP2 collaborates with PDGFB in the development of glioma, but does not provide specific expression levels across different cancer types or discuss its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **O(6)-methyl guanidine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT promoter methylation is mentioned as a biomarker of interest in glioblastomas, but the text does not provide information on its expression levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)**: TERT promoter mutations are discussed in the context of molecular subgroups of glioblastomas, but the text does not specify its expression levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma or its relevance to immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
