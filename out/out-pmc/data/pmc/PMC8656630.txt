I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR (including EGFRvIII mutation)
- PTEN
- TP53

These antigens are mentioned in the context of radiogenomics, which is the study of the relationship between imaging features and genomic characteristics of tumors. The paper discusses the potential of using imaging signatures to predict genetic mutations or expression levels in patients based on their pre-operative MRI scans.

The paper also mentions that these antigens are associated with specific radiographic phenotypes, which can be used to stratify patients into different risk groups based on their radiomic features. However, there is no specific information provided about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
