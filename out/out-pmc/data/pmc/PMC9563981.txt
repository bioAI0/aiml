- **LTB (Lymphotoxin-β)**: LTB is a cytokine from the TNF superfamily that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It is associated with the development of adaptive immunity and inflammation. LTB is expressed by activated T, B, and NK cells, as well as innate lymphoid cells. LTB signaling is required for NK cell development and has been implicated in lymphoid tissue development and tertiary lymphoid structures during development and in cancer. The article mentions that LTB expression was spatially correlated with the MES-like subtype and neurodevelopmental gene expression signatures, which appeared to be associated with prognosis. LTB expression was also found to be enhanced in recurrent human glioblastoma, and high LTB gene expression was associated with a reduced overall survival.
- **LTBR (Lymphotoxin-β Receptor)**: LTBR is the receptor for LTB and is found on stromal and myeloid cells. The article mentions that LTBR expression was spatially correlated with MES-like regions with myeloid and reactive gene expression programs. LTBR expression was highest in MES, followed by classical (CL) samples. However, LTBR expression did not reach statistical significance in terms of clinical outcome.
- **KLRG1 (Killer Cell Lectin-like Receptor G1)**: KLRG1 is a marker gene for exhausted NK cells and is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The article mentions that KLRG1 expression was spatially correlated with LTB expression and lymphoid cell markers.
- **CD117/c-kit**: CD117/c-kit is a marker that is upregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells and is associated with lymphoid tissue development and tertiary lymphoid structures.

- **CD3e and Trac**: CD3e and Trac are T cell markers that are expressed in Cluster 6 of the NK cell subset associated with glioma progression. The article mentions that these cells may represent NKT cells or a recently identified subset of glioma-associated T cells expressing NK cell markers.
- **AIF1/Iba-1**: AIF1/Iba-1 is a pan-myeloid marker that is spatially correlated with LTBR expression. The article mentions that AIF1/Iba-1 was associated with MES-like regions with myeloid and reactive gene expression programs.
- **CD163**: CD163 is a macrophage marker that is spatially correlated with LTBR expression. The article mentions that CD163 was associated with MES-like regions with myeloid and reactive gene expression programs.
