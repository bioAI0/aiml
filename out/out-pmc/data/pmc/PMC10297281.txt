- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- FAP is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on activated fibroblasts such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).
- FAP is selectively overexpressed in a vast majority of neoplasms, particularly epithelial cancers.
- FAP expression is associated with desmoplasia, metastatic spread, and worse clinical outcomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
- FAP expression is associated with angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor cell invasion in ovarian cancer.
- FAP expression is associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, shorter time to recurrence, and overall worse clinical outcomes in epithelial ovarian cancers.
- FAP expression is associated with tumor grade in glial tumors.
- FAP expression levels correlate with tumor grade in glial tumors, with benign brain lesions and low-grade astrocytomas showing negligible FAP expression.
- FAP-specific PET signaling in glioblastomas showed only a moderately positive correlation with rCBV and no correlation with ADC, indicating that FAPI PET imaging is primarily not a surrogate marker of perfusion or cell density, and provides complementary information to MRI.
- FAP expression is associated with dedifferentiation and aggressiveness of thyroid cancer.
