I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Ki-67: Ki-67 is a nuclear protein expressed in proliferating cells, except for G0 cells. It is closely related to cell proliferation and invasion. In ovarian cancer, Ki-67 is associated with recurrence and prognosis. The study mentions that the Ki-67 status in patients with ovarian cancer can be predicted using radiomics from PET, CT, and the Habitat subregion.

- Annexin A2: This antigen plays a critical role in epithelial ovarian cancer.

- CRIP2: CRIP2 is a protein that is related to mesenteric diseases in ovarian cancer patients.

- STXVP2, ASS1, and CBD: These proteins are associated with the heterogeneity of tumor location in ovarian cancer patients.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
