The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, nor does it mention any information on their expression levels across different cancer types. However, it does discuss the expression of certain antigens in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting.

The paper mentions the following antigens:
- O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
- Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
- Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
- Phosphate and tension homology on chromosome 10 (PTEN)
- Ki-67
- TP53

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, but the paper does discuss their expression in glioblastoma and their potential role in distinguishing pseudoprogression from true early progression. For example, the paper states that MGMT promoter methylation status can predict the incidence and outcome of pseudoprogression after concomitant radiochemotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. The paper also mentions that the expression of EGFR, MMP-9, and VEGF is associated with tumor progression and that PTEN expression is associated with tumor suppression.

The paper does not provide any information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it does mention that the expression of these antigens is associated with specific molecular and histological characteristics of glioblastoma, which could potentially be used to distinguish pseudoprogression from true early progression.
