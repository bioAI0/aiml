I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on genetic and epigenetic analysis of astrocytomas, and while it does mention IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, it does not provide any details about antigens or their expression levels in this specific cancer type.
