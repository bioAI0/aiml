- EGFR: The EGFR variant III is mentioned in the context of molecular testing for IDH-wildtype astrocytoma, which may exhibit survival outcomes akin to IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. However, there is no specific information about EGFR expression levels or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- TERT promoter: The TERT promoter mutation is discussed as a potential marker for reclassifying IDH-wildtype astrocytoma to glioblastoma, but there is no data on its expression levels or immunotherapeutic applications.

- IDH1: The article mentions IDH1 mutation testing, but there is no indication of its expression levels or involvement in immunotherapy.

- MGMT promoter: The MGMT promoter methylation is a significant factor in the patient's case, but the text does not provide expression data across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy.
