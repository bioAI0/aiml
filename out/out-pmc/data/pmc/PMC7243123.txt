I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR
- PTEN
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B
- TP53
- RB

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. For example, the paper discusses the use of targeted sequencing to detect specific genetic changes in a predefined set of genes, including EGFR, which is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The paper also mentions the use of immunotherapy, such as tumor treating fields, gamma knife radiosurgery, and immunotherapy, to improve patient care and life expectancy.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
