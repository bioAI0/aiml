I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- TERT promoter
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B
- MTAP
- TP53
- EGFR
- PTEN
- NF1
- BRAF
- PDGFRA
- CDK4
- PIK3CA

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as therapeutic targets for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The study also highlights the clinical actionability of these antigens, meaning the probability of being able to receive appropriate molecular targeting therapeutic agents.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it does mention that the frequency of genomic aberrations for FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 is lower than other MAPK-activating genes such as EGFR and PTEN, but the total proportion of mutations in the FGFR family is not negligible. This suggests that pan-FGFR inhibitors might be an effective treatment for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

Additionally, the paper discusses the potential of using the comprehensive genomic profiling test (CGPT) to detect driver genomic aberrations, enabling glioma patients to participate in clinical trials and the categorization of these patients based on the WHO 2021 classification. The authors emphasize the importance of considering CGPT in the early clinical courses of patients with glioblastoma, given the limited standard treatment options and high recurrence rate.
