- Cathepsin B: This antigen is highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and NanoString gene expression analysis. It is also expressed in other cancer types, such as gliomas, and its expression level has been correlated with tumor aggressiveness and cancer prognosis. Cathepsin B is involved in the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix, facilitating tumor invasion and angiogenesis.

- Cathepsin D: This antigen is also highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as confirmed by IHC staining and NanoString gene analysis. Cathepsin D is overexpressed in various cancers, including gliomas, and its expression level is associated with cancer prognosis. Similar to cathepsin B, cathepsin D contributes to the invasive nature of tumors by degrading the extracellular matrix.

- OCT4: This antigen is a transcription factor critical for maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal. In the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, OCT4 is expressed in a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are believed to be responsible for the poor prognosis associated with this cancer type. The OCT4+ CSC subpopulation is considered the most primitive and may differentiate into SOX2+/SALL4+ progenitor cells.

- SALL4: This antigen is another transcription factor vital for sustaining CSCs. It is expressed in the SALL4+ CSC subpopulation within IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

- SOX2: This antigen is a transcription factor responsible for conferring stem cells with the capacity for unrestricted self-renewal and proliferation. In IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, SOX2 is upregulated in progenitor CSCs and is believed to be regulated by cathepsin B and uPAR.

- Bmi1: This antigen is a protein implicated in brain development and contributes to the aberrant self-renewal and proliferative nature of glioma stem cells. Bmi1 expression is influenced by cathepsin B and uPAR, and its inhibition leads to decreased expression of SOX2.

- ATIIR1 and PRR: These antigens are components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and are expressed by CSC subpopulations within IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The RAS is a complex system involved in regulating cardiovascular homeostasis and has been implicated in cancer progression through the interaction of angiotensin II (ATII) with ATIIR1, leading to angiogenesis, cellular proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis.

- ACE: This antigen is an enzyme that converts angiotensin I (ATI) to ATII in the RAS. It is expressed by CSC subpopulations within IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is a potential target for modulating the RAS in cancer treatment.

- Tryptase: This antigen is a common marker of mast cells and is not co-expressed with cathepsin G in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

The paper does not provide specific information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their direct involvement in immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, the antigens mentioned are highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells and play significant roles in tumor biology, making them potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
