The paper does not explicitly mention any antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does discuss the absence of TERT promoter hotspot mutation in these tumors, which is typically found in adult IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas. The paper also mentions that TERT promoter wildtype-IDH wildtype glioblastomas have a distinct genomic landscape, but it does not provide specific information about antigen expression levels or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
