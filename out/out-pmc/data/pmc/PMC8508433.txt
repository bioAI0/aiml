- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a serine protease that is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are found in most epithelial tumors. FAP is also overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, as demonstrated by Röhrich et al. in their study.
- The study by Röhrich et al. investigated FAP and FAPI-PET/CT in gliomas in vitro, in vivo, and in a clinical study including 18 glioma patients (five IDH-mutant gliomas and 13 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas). The study determined elevated levels of tracer uptake in high-grade gliomas but not in low-grade IDH-mutant gliomas, potentially enabling a non-invasive diagnostic distinction.
- Windisch et al. evaluated the above-mentioned IDH-wildtype glioblastomas regarding their usefulness for radiotherapy or biopsy planning. Compared with MRI, FAPI-PET/CT scans lead to increased gross tumor volumes (GTVs), thus changing radiation treatment fields.
- The expression of FAP in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas is associated with tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, the exact role of FAP in tumorigenesis is unknown.
- FAP influences angiogenesis, presumably based on its enzymatic activity, and is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is eventually required for the development of metastasis by enabling migration and invasion.
- FAP is only overexpressed by activated fibroblasts, suggesting that CAFs play a major role in cancer growth.
- The overexpression of FAP in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas is associated with a poor prognosis.
