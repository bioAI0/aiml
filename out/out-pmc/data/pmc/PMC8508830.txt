- EGFR: EGFR overexpression and/or mutations play a central role in cell division, migration, adhesion, differentiation, and apoptosis. Genetic alterations in EGFR—including mutations, rearrangements, alternative splicing, and focal amplifications—are the dominant receptor tyrosine kinase lesions in GBM. EGFR deletions and point mutations that keep EGFR in an active conformation are found in 57% of GBMs. EGFR(△2–7) is characterized by a 267 amino acid deletion in the extracellular domain, which results in a receptor that cannot bind ligand and is constitutively active. EGFR(△2–7) is thought to represent a late event, occurring after EGFR-wildtype amplification. EGFR amplification and EGFR(△2–7) mutations might represent concerted evolutionary events that drive the aggressive nature of GBM by promoting invasion and angiogenesis via distinct signaling pathways.
- EGFR amplifications have been reported to indicate a much more aggressive tumor subpopulation. Aibaidula et al. reported patients with EGFR-amplified LGGs had significantly shorter OS than those with EGFR non-amplified tumors (median OS 1.03 y vs. 2.67 y, p = 0.003). Labussière et al. suggested that the influence of EGFR status on prognosis could be more complicated; patients with EGFR amplifications had a better prognosis in the TERT-mutated context than patients with TERT-wildtype tumors. On the other hand, EGFR-wildtype GBM patients had longer survival with TERT-wildtype than patients with EGFR-wildtype and TERT-mutated. Zou et al. showed that EGFR amplification and IDH mutations are mutually exclusive. Therefore, further research is required to determine their multi-genic interaction.
- In LGG, EGFR mutations indicate increased lesion infiltration of specific immune cell types and a poor prognosis. EGFR(△2–7) confers a growth advantage to GBM, and patients with EGFR(△2–7) mutations have significantly shorter survival. EGFR(△2–7) overexpression in the presence of EGFR amplification is the strongest indicator of a poor prognosis.
- On top of that, in WHO CNS5 EGFR gene amplification is one of the criteria to upgrade IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic tumor in adults to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype.
- In summary, currently EGFR-targeting drugs do not prolong OS and PFS, but intensive research for new types of drugs is ongoing.
