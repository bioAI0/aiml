- **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**: EGFR is a well-known antigen that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, survival, and migration. The article mentions EGFR amplification as a molecular feature in IDH-wildtype astrocytomas, which are diagnosed as glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade IV.

- **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)**: TERT is another antigen associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. TERT promoter mutation is listed as a molecular feature in IDH-wildtype astrocytomas, which are classified as glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, CNS WHO grade IV. TERT promoter mutations are known to activate telomerase, leading to telomere lengthening and promoting cellular immortality.

- **PDGFRA (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha)**: While not directly mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, PDGFRA is discussed as a potential targetable oncogene in G34R/V glioma, which shares some similarities with IDH-mutant glioma. The article suggests that PDGFRA is upregulated through epigenomic reprogramming in IDH1-mutant glioma, but the mechanism of gliomagenesis remains to be investigated.

- **IDH1-R132H**: IDH1-R132H is a specific mutation of the IDH1 gene, which is associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The article mentions that IDH1-R132H is not essential for glioma progression, and IDH1-mutant inhibitors may desensitize glioma cells due to increased NADPH production. However, the clinical outcomes of these inhibitors are yet to be determined.

- **IDH2 Mutations**: IDH2 mutations are also mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The article discusses the presence of IDH2 mutations in healthy human tissues, such as the heart and skeletal muscle, and their association with cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy.

- **CDKN2A/B (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A/B)**: CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion is a significant molecular feature in IDH-mutant astrocytoma, which is classified as CNS WHO grade IV. However, the article does not provide information on the expression levels of CDKN2A/B across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

- **TP53 (Tumor Protein p53)**: TP53 alteration is mentioned in the context of IDH-mutant astrocytoma, where it is associated with shortened overall survival compared to IDH-mutant astrocytoma with TP53-wildtype. The article suggests that TP53 alteration weakens the anti-proliferative activity of IDH1 mutation. However, there is no specific information provided on the expression levels of TP53 across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
