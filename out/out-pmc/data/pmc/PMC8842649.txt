I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFRvIII: This antigen is mentioned in the context of immunotherapy, specifically chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, for recurrent glioblastoma. The study by Wang et al. (2019) used multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to assess anti-EGFRvIII chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
- CDKN2A: This antigen is mentioned in the context of radiotherapeutic response in patients with primary glioblastoma. The study by Yang et al. (2019) used a radiogenomic approach to identify cancer genetic markers according to radiotherapeutic response in patients with primary glioblastoma.

These antigens are not mentioned in the context of their expression levels across different cancer types, and there is no further information provided about their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
