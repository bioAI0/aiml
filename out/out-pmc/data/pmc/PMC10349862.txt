I'm sorry, I could not find any information in the provided text about antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. The text does not mention any specific antigens or their expression levels in different cancer types. It also does not discuss immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of these antigens.
