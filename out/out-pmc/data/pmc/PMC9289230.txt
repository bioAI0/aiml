- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - S100A4: A novel biomarker expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that induces the tumorigenic activity of neutrophils.
   - CD133: A surface marker of GSCs, whose increased expression induces IL-1β expression, leading to neutrophil aggregation in the tumor microenvironment.
   - FasL: Expressed on gliomas, it activates Fas signaling in the tumor microenvironment, leading to IL-8 expression and neutrophil accumulation.
   - CD96: Elevated expression in IDH-wildtype glioma, associated with poor prognosis and high tumor immune infiltration.
   - TYROBP: Overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioma, associated with poor prognosis and high tumor immune infiltration.
   - BCL7A: Low expression in IDH-wildtype glioma, correlated with robust infiltration of neutrophils.

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - S100A4: Also expressed in other cancer types, such as breast cancer, and is associated with tumor progression and metastasis.
   - CD133: Overexpressed in various cancer types, including colorectal cancer, and is associated with tumor progression and metastasis.
   - FasL: Expressed in various cancer types, including melanoma, and is involved in tumor progression and metastasis.
   - CD96: Overexpressed in various cancer types, including lung cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis and tumor immune infiltration.
   - TYROBP: Overexpressed in various cancer types, including colorectal cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis and tumor immune infiltration.
   - BCL7A: Low expression in various cancer types, including glioma, and is associated with tumor immune infiltration.

- **Mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - S100A4: Induces the tumorigenic activity of neutrophils and promotes the mesenchymal transformation of gliomas, making it a potential target for immunotherapy.
   - CD133: Its increased expression induces IL-1β expression, leading to neutrophil aggregation, suggesting a role in tumor targeting.
   - FasL: Activates Fas signaling in the tumor microenvironment, leading to IL-8 expression and neutrophil accumulation, which could be targeted for immunotherapy.
   - CD96: Overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and high tumor immune infiltration, making it a potential target for immunotherapy.
   - TYROBP: Overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and high tumor immune infiltration, suggesting a role in tumor targeting.
   - BCL7A: Low expression is correlated with robust infiltration of neutrophils, indicating a potential role in tumor targeting or immunotherapy.
