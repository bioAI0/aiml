- Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)
- PDK4 is a target of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and is affected by carnosine, a naturally occurring dipeptide with anti-neoplastic properties.
- The study found that carnosine significantly increased PDK4 expression in both U87 and T98G glioblastoma cell lines, while the PI3K inhibitor Ly-294,002 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin also increased PDK4 expression in U87 cells.
- The authors hypothesized that carnosine's anti-neoplastic effect may be mediated by an influence on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, as PDK4 expression is regulated by transcription factors downstream of this pathway.
- However, reporter gene assays revealed no specific effect of carnosine on the human PDK4 promoter, suggesting that carnosine's effect on PDK4 expression is independent of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.
- The study also found that carnosine reduced cell viability in both U87 and T98G cells, while rapamycin and Ly-294,002 had no significant effect on cell viability.
- The authors concluded that carnosine's anti-neoplastic effect is independent of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and suggested that further investigation of its mechanisms of action and consideration for therapy is warranted, especially given its natural occurrence and lack of side effects in the treatment of other diseases.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of PDK4 across different cancer types or its mention in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
