- **PSMA**: PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancer and has recently emerged as a target for radionuclide imaging and treatment of this tumour. PSMA is expressed not only in prostate cancer, but also in other solid tumours including brain tumours and correlates with the WHO grade. PSMA expression was found in endothelial cells associated with neovascularization and, for these reasons, can be a very interesting marker for monitoring anti-angiogenic drugs.
- **FAP**: FAP-positive signalling of extracranial tumours is attributed to activated Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) that are located in the stromal compound of these tumours and overexpress FAP. In parallel, patients underwent multimodal MRI. FAP specific PET and rCBV MRI scans are modestly correlated and no correlation between the FAP-based PET and the ADC sequence has been observed, suggesting that FAP-specific PET could be useful in biopsy organization and discrimination between pseudo-progression and tumour progression after radiation therapy for GBM imaging.
- **TSPO**: TSPO is a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, composed of a transmembrane multimeric protein complex of 18-kDa, situated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. TSPO is widely distributed in most peripheral organs. In addition, TSPO is also minimally expressed in resting microglial cells in the healthy brain but is substantially upregulated in reactive astrocytes and predominantly during the microglia activation process, due to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. Moreover, most glioma cells express the TSPO. Different studies demonstrated a positive correlation between TSPO expression and grade of malignancy and a negative correlation with survival. The most used TSPO radiotracer is [11C](R)PK11195. Su et al. found that [11C](R)PK11195 uptake in high-grade gliomas was significantly higher than in low-grade astrocytomas and low-grade oligodendrogliomas. TSPO in gliomas was expressed predominantly by neoplastic cells, and its expression correlated positively with uptake in the tumours indicating that [11C](R)PK11195 can be used to stratify patients. Considering the short half-life of 11C-labelled compounds, other new generations TSPO specific ligands have been developed, such as [18F]DPA-714 and [18F]GE-180. In a human glioma-injected mouse model, obtained after the injection in the brain of Gli36dEGFR-LITG, Zinnhardt et al. performed multi tracer imaging PET studies ([18F]FET, [18F]DPA-714, and [18F]BR-351, this last for MMPs) to evaluate the inflammatory tumour microenvironment. Authors found that the three radiotracers only partially overlapped; glioma cells overexpressed TSPO contributing to the most of [18F]DPA-714 uptake, but also infiltrating glioma associated myeloid cells (GAMs) showed an important TSPO and MMP expression. In another study performed in patients with glioma, authors found a strong relationship (r = 0.84, p = 0.009) between the [18F]DPA-714 uptake and the number and activation level of GAMs. TSPO expression was mainly restricted to human leukocyte antigen D related-positive (HLA-DR+) activated GAMs, particularly to tumour-infiltrating HLA-DR+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumour-associated macrophages indicating that TSPO radiotracer could be useful to study tumour microenvironment. At the same time, in a preclinical model obtained with human GBM cells from patient, [18F]DPA-714 was able to detect glioma infiltration into the contralateral brain earlier than [18F]FET. In parallel, DWI MRI provides microstructure information. Authors also found an abundance of CD11b+ GAMs inside and around the tumour. We have recently developed and characterised a new TSPO radiotracer, [18F]VC701 in neuroinflammation models. Similarly, in an orthotopic glioma model obtained with murine GBM cells, the GL261 ones, we observed an earlier TSPO uptake signal compared to [18F]FLT uptake (Figure 2). Furthermore, the radiotracer [18F]GE-180 seems to provide interesting results in patients and the uptake correlates with the grade of tumour. Other radiotracers are now under development to increase the specificity to TSPO.
- **MT1-MMP**: MT1-MMP or MMP-14 is another attractive biomarker for tumour therapy and imaging. MMPs are linked to increased cell proliferation, tumour invasion, migration, and poor prognosis in glioma patients. Moreover, MMPs facilitate microglia-mediated glioma invasion by degrading the basement membrane and proteins of the ECM. Besides that, MMPs affect the neuroinflammatory milieu by modulating the expression and activity of chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and receptor turnover. Several molecules have been recently developed to study MMPs. For example, de Lucas et al. evaluated an immunoPET tracer for the membrane-type 1 matrix metallo-proteinase (MT1-MMP or MMP-14), [89Zr]DFO-LEM2/15, in xenograft and orthotopic brain GBM models. This tracer displayed the higher uptake after 24 h post injection in tumours with high expression of MT1-MMP but a severe disruption of the BBB is needed to visualise intra brain tumours. Zinnhardt and colleagues, in a multiple tracers study to evaluate the inflammatory microenvironment in an orthotopic glioma model, used the MMP inhibitor compound (R)-2-(N-benzyl-4-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)phenylsulphonamido)-N-hydroxy-3-methylbutanamide ([18F]BR-351), which binds to the activated forms of MMP-2, -8, -9, and -13. Areas of exclusive [18F]BR-351 were observed at the outer borders of the tumour volume and the area of radiotracer uptake agreed with in situ zymography, indicating elevated levels of activated MMP-2 and MMP-9.
- **MMP-2/9**: Wang et al. synthesized a membrane-penetrating cyclic peptide, named iCREKA, labelled by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and positron emitter 18F. The cyclic peptide iCREKA reaches tumour tissues via blood circulation. CREKA is expected to specifically bind to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes that are widely and abundantly distributed in tumour stroma. MMP-2/9 recognize and cleave iCREKA between CREKA and the membrane-penetrating peptide, while hydrolytic enzymes hydrolyze the disulfide bond. As a result, the fluorescent or radionuclide-labelled membrane penetrating peptide is released, which enters the plasma membrane and the tumour cells. The microPET/CT imaging demonstrated that [18F]iCREKA could target U87MG xenograft tumour in vivo from 30 min to 2 h after injection.
- **MMP-14**: Zhao et al. investigated the biodistribution and uptake of [18F]-fluoropropionyl-chlorotoxin ([18F]-FP-chlorotoxin), which binds to MMP-2 in an orthotopic rat C6 glioma model. The uptake of the tracer in the normal brain is very low and a high accumulation was found in the glioma tissue. The tumour to normal brain ratio of [18F]-FP-chlorotoxin was higher than that of [18F]FDG with the maximum uptake at 90 min.
- **MMP-14**: Kasten and colleagues designed an MMP-14-activatable dual PET/NIRF peptide probe for imaging and guiding resection of glioma. The peptide probe combined (1) a NIRF reporter and quencher pair separated by a peptide sequence (MMP-14 “substrate peptide”) that is cleaved specifically by activated MMP-14 to release the quencher and allows visualization of the NIRF dye; and (2) a chelate for radionuclides attached to a peptide sequence, that binds to MMP-14 (MMP-14 “binding peptide”) and enables PET imaging. For PET imaging the peptide was labelled with [68Ga] or [64Cu] and biodistribution was evaluated in an orthotopic glioma model obtained with PDX JX12 tumour. Both [68Ga]binding-peptide and [64Cu]binding-peptide allow to visualize PDX tumours. PET and NIRF signals correlated linearly in the orthotopic PDX tumours and the signals co-localized with MMP-14 expression identified with immunohistochemistry.
