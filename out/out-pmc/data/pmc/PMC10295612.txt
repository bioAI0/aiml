- **EGFRvIII**: A ligand-independent, constitutively active splice variant of EGFR that promotes tumor growth and resistance to adjuvant TMZ treatment. It is expressed in about 30% of GBM and has been evaluated as a target for peptide vaccines in phase II studies.
- **PD-L1**: Programmed death ligand 1, a peculiar ligand that induces T cell apoptosis by binding to its receptor, programmed death 1 (PD-1), which is present on activated T cells mainly in peripheral organs. PD-L1 expression can be augmented by inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferons, and at the same time, PD-L1 promotes CD8+ T cell production of tumor-specific interferon-γ. PD-L1 is expressed in multiple tumors, including glioblastoma. In GBM, expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells has been linked to the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss and PI3K-PTEN-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway overactivation.
- **HER2**: Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2, a target for CAR-T cell therapy in glioblastoma. HER2-specific CAR-modified virus-specific T cells (VSTs) have been tested for safety and anti-GBM activity in patients with progressive HER2-positive GBM.
- **IL13Rα2**: Interleukin 13 Receptor alpha 2, a target for CAR-T cell therapy in glioblastoma. IL13Rα2 is overexpressed in more than 50% of GBM and not expressed at significant levels on normal brain tissue. IL13Rα2 expression seems to be more closely associated with differentiated malignant cells and tumor-infiltrating macrophages-derived suppressor cells, representing a prognostic indicator of poor patient survival.
- **EphA2**: A target for CAR-T cell therapy in glioblastoma. Promising results in terms of mitigating antigen escape have been demonstrated with HER2 and IL13Rα2-directed tandem CAR-T cells, trivalent CAR-T cells targeting HER2, IL13Rα2, and EphA2, and CAR-T cells against EGFR and EGFRvIII in animal models.
