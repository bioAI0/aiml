- **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**: EGFR is overexpressed in most primary glioblastomas and some secondary glioblastomas, particularly in more aggressive glioblastoma phenotypes. Mutations in EGFR occur in roughly one-third of all classical tumors and often in mesenchymal, proneural, and neural glioblastomas. The article mentions that EGFR activation can be increased in various ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ways, and that EGFR is overexpressed in glioblastoma, promoting tumor growth and invasion.

- **GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)**: GFAP is an intermediate filament protein found in gliomas that astrocytes and neural progenitor cells generate. Changes in GFAP alternative splicing are linked to glioma malignancy. The canonical isoform GFAP is downregulated in higher-grade cancers, resulting in greater GFAP isoform dominance in the network. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of GFAP across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **TP53**: TP53 is one of the most commonly deregulated genes in cancer. The p53-ARF-MDM2 pathway is deregulated in 84% of glioblastoma patients and 94% of glioblastoma cell lines. Deregulated p53 pathway components have been implicated in glioblastoma cell invasion, migration, proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, and cancer cell stemness. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of TP53 across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **ATRX (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked)**: ATRX is a chromatin remodeler protein, recurrently mutated in WHO grade II/III astrocytic glioma and secondary glioblastoma. The article does not provide information on the expression levels of ATRX across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Ki-67**: Ki-67 is a nuclear protein that reflects the physiological proliferative state of the cells in which this marker is expressed. The Ki-67 labeling index (LI) increases with increasing WHO grade, and high Ki-67 expression is related to lesion volume, an increased risk of recurrence, and a poor prognosis. The article mentions that Ki-67 is evaluated using the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, which stains nuclei reacting with nuclear proteins expressed in the cell cycle's GI, S, G2, and M phases. The nuclear positivity found for Ki-67 is expressed in percentage, KI-67 labeling index (LI). The article also discusses the correlation between the percentage staining of Ki-67 and overall survival in patients with IDH-WT glioblastoma, specifically that the percentage of Ki-67 staining >20% predicts poorer progression-free survival. However, there is still a debate on this in the literature, and existing papers report different results.
