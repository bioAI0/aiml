- **CD70**: CD70 is a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, particularly in the epithelioid glioblastoma and gliosarcoma variants. It is also overexpressed in recurrent tumors and tumors with MES gene signatures of GBM, and plays a role in promoting tumor migration. Ablation of CD70 in glioblastoma cells reduced genes correlated with tumor epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as SOX-2 and CD44, and inhibited the migration and growth of the tumor. Targeting CD70Pos glioblastoma cells with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T-cells) triggered a strong antitumor response, suggesting that CD70 is a promising tumor immunotherapeutic target in GBM.
- **CD133**: CD133 is a CSCs marker associated with cancer progression and tumorigenesis in various tumors, including gliomas. In glioblastoma, overexpression of CD133 has been linked to CSCs’ self-renewal and resistance towards temozolomide (TMZ) by the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and Notch/sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathways. CD133Pos cells populations were found to be highly associated with aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1), another putative marker that promotes poor prognosis and chemoresistance.
- **CD44**: CD44 is a large cell adhesion molecule that acts as a receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA), a major element of the extracellular matrix. It is expressed with the highest expression of 55.55% in GBM. CD44 cleavage and secretion take place at a massive rate on the leading edge of the tumor, and standard CD44 (sCD44) was discovered in the opposite hemisphere of the brain, indicating that sCD44 is capable of propagating or circulating in the brain. sCD44 was shown to activate abnormal Tau pathology features, which indicates that sCD44 plays a pathological role between glioblastoma and neurodegeneration. Elevated levels of CD44 are present within the invaded location at the tumor margin, and GSCs with greater expression of CD44 in the tumor margin in comparison with the center correlates with highly invasive feature, shorter survival, and faster tumor progression.
- **CD15**: CD15 is a trisaccharide 3-fucosyl-N-acetyllactosamine, and is widely known as stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1). It has been confirmed to be prominently upregulated in various types of neutrophils and macrophages, and in several cancers. In the adult brain, CD15 was shown to be remarkably expressed on pluripotent SCs and neural stem cells (NSCs), where it is believed to play a role in cell–cell interaction throughout neuronal growth. PN subtype GSCs significantly express CD15 at the cell surface along with CD133. The expression proportion of CD15 was found to be upregulated in non-CSCs under hypoxic conditions, and hypoxia actually induced sphere formation in glioblastoma-sorted non-CSCs and those newly formed spheres are highly expressed in SC markers, including CD15. This indicates that CD15Pos GSCs can be stimulated throughout dedifferentiation under a hypoxic environment, and this interchange between non-GSCs and GSCs perhaps promotes the cancer to become more malignant.
