The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- CD44: This antigen is mentioned in the context of immunotherapy, as it is a marker of mesenchymal-type cells and is reduced in macroH2A2 knockdown cells. The paper suggests that macroH2A2 is involved in mediating state transitions in GSCs, and that knockdown of macroH2A2 pushes cells away from MES states and toward more pronounced NPC/OPC transcriptional states.
- PDGFRA: This antigen is mentioned in the context of tumor targeting, as it is a marker of the oligodendrocytic lineage and is upregulated upon macroH2A2 knockdown. The paper suggests that macroH2A2 represses this gene associated with the oligodendrocytic lineage by compacting the chromatin at its cognate enhancer element.
- OLIG2: This antigen is mentioned in the context of tumor targeting, as it is a marker of the oligodendrocytic lineage and is upregulated upon macroH2A2 knockdown. The paper suggests that macroH2A2 represses this gene associated with the oligodendrocytic lineage by compacting the chromatin at its cognate enhancer element.
- SOX2: This antigen is mentioned in the context of tumor targeting, as it is a marker of the oligodendrocytic lineage and is upregulated upon macroH2A2 knockdown. The paper suggests that macroH2A2 represses this gene associated with the oligodendrocytic lineage by compacting the chromatin at its cognate enhancer element.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
