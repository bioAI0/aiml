I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- PD1/PD-L1
- CTLA-4

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. The study suggests that high expression of REST may be associated with the expression of these immune checkpoints, which are known to play a role in tumor immune escape. The authors propose that targeting REST could potentially increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in glioma.

Additionally, the study mentions the following antigens in the context of immune cell infiltration in glioma:

- B cell biomarkers (CD19 and CD79A)
- CD4+ immune cell biomarker (CD4)
- M1 macrophage biomarkers (IRF5 and PTGS2)
- M2 macrophage biomarkers (CD163, VSIG4, and MS4A4A)
- Neutrophil biomarker (ITGAM)
- Dendritic cell biomarkers (HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DPA1, CD1C, NRP1, and ITGAX)

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but they are discussed in relation to immune cell infiltration and the tumor microenvironment in glioma.
