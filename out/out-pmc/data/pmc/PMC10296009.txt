- EGFR type III mutant: The most frequently observed tumor-specific antigen (TSA) in glioblastoma, found in 20-30% of cases. Initial results were encouraging, but more recent studies have not been as promising, slowing down further development of EGFR-based vaccines.
- IDH mutations: Specific to grade 4 astrocytoma, which could be leveraged to develop a vaccine. IDH-based vaccines induce antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and humoral immunity. Clinical trials of these vaccines are still underway.
- EGFR: A potential target for immunotherapy, but its expression is not limited to IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

The paper also mentions the use of autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, which are pulsed with lysate derived from GBM stem-like cell lines. These vaccines are safe and well-tolerated, and have shown improved outcomes in patients receiving DC vaccines. However, the paper does not specify the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
