- **EGFRvIII**: This is a common mutation event in GBM patients, and it is not expressed in normal tissues. It has been proposed as a tumor-specific antigen for the development of T-cell bispecific antibodies (TCB) that can bind both the T-cell receptor and tumor-specific antigens. EGFRvIII-TCB has shown specificity for EGFRvIII and promoted tumor cell killing, as well as T-cell activation.
- **PDGFR**: This is a receptor that is overexpressed in GBM cells, and it has been targeted in combination with VEGFR inhibitors to block ligand-independent and dependent signaling pathways.
- **VEGFR1**: This is a receptor that is highly expressed in GBM tumor cells, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and infiltrating fibroblasts. Its expression has been shown to positively correlate with the number of macrophages in tumors.
- **CXCR4**: This is a receptor that is overexpressed in numerous human cancers, including glioma, and it has been shown to promote tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, relapse, and therapeutic resistance. It is also found in TAMs, and its inhibition has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy.
- **CD40**: This is a molecular target that has been proposed for reprogramming M2 TAMs to an antitumoral phenotype in GBM management. Agonistic CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been used for this purpose, and some studies have shown efficacy when combining these mAB with other molecular treatments to increase therapeutic success.
