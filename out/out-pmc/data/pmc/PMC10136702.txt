- **EGFRvIII**: This antigen is expressed on the surface of tumor cells and is not expressed in normal tissues. It represents a common mutation event in GBM patients. EGFRvIII-TCB showed specificity for EGFRvIII and promoted tumor cell killing as well as T-cell activation. In addition, EGFRvIII-TCB promoted T-cell recruitment into GBM animal models.
- **PDGFR**: This antigen is overexpressed in EGFR-dependent tumors, which would develop drug treatment resistance.
- **VEGFR1**: This antigen is expressed in GBM tumor cells, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and infiltrating fibroblasts. Its expression has been shown to positively correlate with the number of macrophages in tumors.
- **CXCR4**: This antigen is overexpressed in numerous human cancers, including glioma, and it has been shown to promote tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, relapse, and therapeutic resistance. It is also found in TAMs.
- **EGFR**: This antigen is amplified and/or mutated in many GBMs, and to a lesser extent, they overexpress PDGF receptors. Those EGFR-dependent tumors would develop drug treatment resistance.
