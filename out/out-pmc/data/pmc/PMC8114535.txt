I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- B-Raf
- BRAF
- BRAFV600E
- BRAFnon-V600E
- IDH1/2
- IDH1
- IDH2
- ATRX
- TP53
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the following information on their expression levels across different cancer types:

- B-Raf is a serine-threonine kinase in the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which transduces mitogenic stimuli after the activation by growth factor receptors that are involved in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. MAPK pathway activation is common in various neoplasms, and active RAS mutations have been detected in approximately 15% of malignant human tumors.
- Compared with ARAF and RAF1, BRAF plays a critical role in kinase activity. A previous study showed that RAF1 is activated by BRAF through direct interactions between proteins and phosphorylation. BRAF participates in the pathological mechanism of 7% of human neoplasms, especially in patients with melanoma and colorectal, thyroid, and lung cancer. The expression of BRAF is highly restrained, and the high expression of BRAF in neural cells indicates that it is a vital MEK kinase in neuronal tissues. BRAF mutations are found in some central nervous system neoplasms. In pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs), these alterations correlate with oncogenic senescence, which may contribute to an improved prognosis. The BRAFV600E mutation is rare in adult LGGs and glioblastomas and can only be found in 1 to 5% of samples. While BRAF activation contributes to tumor development and progression in the neural stem cells and progenitor cells of Homo sapiens, BRAF mutations are detected in adult diffuse gliomas and are associated with poor outcomes.
- Most studies have focused on the BRAFV600E mutation, although more than 70 BRAF mutations have been reported to date. Mutations in BRAF at V600 can activate ERK, which plays a critical role in the G1/S transition by adjusting the expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, and p21Cip1. The BRAFV600E mutation is the most potent MAPK pathway activator, whereas BRAFnon-V600E mutations are low-activity kinases that slightly stimulate the MAPK pathway. However, these low-activity BRAF mutants could activate MAPK signaling in COS-1 cells to a high level by activating RAF1.
- Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a frequent mutation associated with a survival benefit in glioma patients and it has been defined as a molecular parameter to define the categories of brain tumors in the updated 2016 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS). IDH1 and BRAFV600E mutations are associated with infiltrative gliomas or circumscribed gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, respectively, and they are exclusive in most cases. The exact effect of BRAF non-V600E and BRAFV600E on the prognosis of glioma patients and whether there are unique molecular characteristics in their MAPK and p53 pathways remain largely unknown.
- In this study, co-occurring mutations and copy number alterations of 35 associated genes in the MAPK and p53 pathways were retrieved and investigated, and the prognosis of the available adult glioma cohorts with BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E were evaluated by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database. The authors determined that BRAFnon-V600E exhibited a stronger association with the IDH1/2 mutation than BRAFV600E, but no survival advantage was found.
- The study populations were divided into two groups, BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E. The major demographic characteristics and clinical data of the two groups are summarized in Table 2. The patients’ ages ranged from 20 to 85 years and were divided into early adulthood, midlife, mature adulthood, and late adulthood (aged 20–35, 35–50, 50–80, and >80 years, respectively). The two groups had comparable proportions of male patients, diagnosis age, cancer type, and overall survival status. Glioblastoma multiform was the most common cancer type in both cohorts (74.07% vs. 56.00%; P=0.175; Table 2).
- The mutation frequencies of KRAS, HRAS, RAF1, MAP 3K1, MAP 2K1, MAP 2K2, MAP 2K4, MDM2, MDM4, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B were comparable between the two groups. In contrast, the BRAFnon-V600E group exhibited a significantly higher mutation frequency of TP53 (56.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.001), IDH1/2 (36.00% vs. 3.70%; P=0.015), and ATRX (32.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.037) than the BRAFV600E group. The variables with P<0.10 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the BRAFnon-V600E group exhibited a significantly higher TP53 mutation frequency (56.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.031) than the BRAFV600E group (Table 3).
- There were no available copy number data for five patients with BRAFV600E and five patients with BRAFnon-V600E. The copy number alterations of the available co-occurring genes included BRAF, RAF1, MAP 3K1, MAP 2K1, MAP 2K2, MAP 2K4, MAPK1, MAPK3, TP53, MDM2, MDM4, TP53BP1, IDH1, IDH2, ATRX, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B. The HD copy number was frequently retrieved for these two genes, including CDKN2A and CDKN2B (Fig. 2), and the HD of both CDKN2A (77.27.00% vs. 60.00%; P=0.032) and CDKN2B (77.27.00% vs. 60.00%; P=0.032) was more frequent in the BRAFV600E cohort than in the BRAFnon-V600E cohort (Table 4).
- The estimated mean survival time was 51.394 months for patients with BRAFV600E, 89.958 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E, 44.500 months for patients with BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT, and 93.821 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT. There was no difference between the survival of BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E (51.394 vs. 89.958, chi-square 1.130, P=0.288). In addition, there was no difference between the survival of BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT and BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT (44.500 vs. 93.821, chi-square 0.007, P=0.935), which excluded the survival benefit of IDH1/2. The authors also evaluated the survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop and activation segment. The estimated survival time of these two subgroups was 12.250 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop and 34.800 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the activation segment. In addition, there was no difference between the BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT cohorts and those of the BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT cohorts. As shown below, BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT vs. BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT had mutations in the G-loop (44.500 vs. 12.250, chi-squared 0.122, P=0.727), and BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT vs. BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT had mutations in the activation segment (44.500 vs. 34.800, chi-square 0.145, P=0.703). Since the estimated mean survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop was the shortest, the authors compared the BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop with the remaining BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT patients. There was no difference between them (12.250 vs. 95.100, chi-square 0.008, P=0.927) (Fig. 3). The numbers at risk of Kaplan–Meier survival curves were shown in Supplementary Dataset S2.
- The authors propose that a larger sample is necessary for confirmation of this finding. Their data indicated that the BRAFnon-V600E cohort had no survival advantage from co-occurrence with IDH mutations compared with the BRAFnon-V600E cohort of adult patients with glioma.
- The authors conclude that in adult patients with gliomas, BRAFnon-V600E, rather than BRAFV600E, frequently co-occurs with TP53, IDH1/2, and ATRX mutations. Both BRAFnon-V600E and BRAFV600E frequently overlapped with CDKN2A/2B HDs, whereas there were no significant differences between the two cohorts. Although there were significant differences in co-occurring gene mutations and copy number alterations, no difference was found in survival between cohorts of BRAFnon-V600E and BRAFV600E with and without IDH1/2 favorable effects on survival. They also found that the estimated mean survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop was the shortest; however, no difference was observed between that cohort and other cohorts. Due to the poor available mRNA and protein data in the TCGA database they retrieved in this study, no expression data were evaluated. More clinical data or models are necessary to elucidate the mechanism involved in BRAFnon-V600E-associated glioma in the future.
