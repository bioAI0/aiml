I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Nestin: Nestin is a protein that is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and is often used as a marker for these cells. In the paper, nestin is used to identify potential tumour progenitor cells (pTPCs) in primary glioblastoma cells. The authors found that 98% of the primary glioblastoma cells were nestin-positive/GFAP-negative pTPCs, indicating a high level of expression of nestin in these cells.

- GFAP: GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) is a protein that is highly expressed in astrocytes and is often used as a marker for these cells. In the paper, GFAP is used to identify differentiated cells in primary glioblastoma cells. The authors found that only 2% of the primary glioblastoma cells showed GFAP positive staining, indicating a low level of expression of GFAP in these cells.

The paper does not provide any information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their use in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
