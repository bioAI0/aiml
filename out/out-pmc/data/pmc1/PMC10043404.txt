The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following molecular markers that are associated with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and have prognostic implications:

- EGFR amplification
- TERT promoter mutation
- Chromosome +7/-10 copy number variation

These molecular markers are not discussed in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the paper.
