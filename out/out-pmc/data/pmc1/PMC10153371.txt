I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR: The study mentions EGFR amplification as a recognized molecular change present in glioblastoma, with 56% of patients in the study showing EGFR amplification.
- MGMT: The study discusses the prognostic significance of MGMT promoter methylation status in glioblastoma, with unmethylated MGMT promoter status being observed in 57% of patients in the study.
- ATRX: The study reports that 98% of patients had ATRX locus intact, indicating the absence of ATRX mutations.
- p53: The study found that 78% of patients had p53 mutations, as defined by positivity in over 10% of cells.

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text. However, the study does discuss the use of PDL-1 immunohistochemistry quantification, which is relevant to immunotherapy. The study also highlights the importance of identifying low-cost predictive biomarkers for glioblastoma patient survival, which could potentially include these antigens.
