The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. It does, however, mention the IDH1 G105G SNP, which was not found to have any prognostic impact on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The paper also discusses the role of SESN2 in glioma and its correlation with immune cell infiltration, but does not provide information on its expression levels across different cancer types or its potential as a target for immunotherapy.
