- **Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)**: MHC expression is downregulated in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, which restricts antigen presentation and contributes to immune escape.
- **Fas-ligand**: Increased expression of Fas-ligand in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma promotes cell death in leukocytes, further suppressing the immune response.
- **Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)**: TGF-β is secreted by IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells and contributes to immunosuppression by inhibiting the activity of immune cells.
- **Interleukin-10 (IL-10)**: IL-10 is another cytokine secreted by IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cells, which has immunosuppressive effects and contributes to immune escape.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The paper discusses the potential of genetically modified immune cells and augmentation of the immune response to overcome the challenges posed by these antigens in treating IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
