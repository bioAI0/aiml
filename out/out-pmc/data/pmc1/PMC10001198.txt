I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR

The paper mentions EGFR amplification as a classic molecular marker, and a study by Higa et al. (2023) found that EGFR alterations were distributed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a favorable prognostic impact. However, the paper does not provide information on the expression levels of EGFR across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
