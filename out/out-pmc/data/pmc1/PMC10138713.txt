- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - GLUT3 is highly expressed in classical and proneural GBM subtypes.
   - HK2 is overexpressed in developing embryos and GBM tissue.
   - PKM2 is upregulated in GBM specimens.
   - MPC1 is under-expressed in gliomas.
   - PDP1 is repressed in patient-derived GBM samples.
   - TERT-promoter mutations are commonly found in GBM and oligodendroglioma.
   - TERT downregulation results in decreased expression of PGC-1α.
   - EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).
   - HIF-1α is required for EZH2-mediated metabolic adaptation in gliomas.
   - SLC7A11 expression is associated with seizures and predicts poor survival in patients with malignant glioma.
   - xCT is responsible for glioma-mediated neuronal toxicity via glutamate release.
   - IDH-wildtype gliomas utilize glutamine and glucose for metabolic pathways.
   - IDH1-mutant gliomas depend on glutamate and lactate.

- **Mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - The combined targeting of EGFR signaling and polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis displays a synergistic effect on GSCs.
   - The combined inhibition of mTOR kinase and glutaminase profoundly reduces tumor growth in a GBM xenograft model.
   - The pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR kinase promotes cystine uptake and glutamate secretion via the cysteine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) encoded by the SLC7A11 gene.
   - The treatment of sulfasalazine (SAS), an FDA-approved xCT inhibitor, reduces peritumoral glutamate in glioma patients.
   - IDH mutations or the epigenetic effect of 2-HG can decrease the level of NAD+, and inhibiting nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) can induce cytotoxicity in endogenous IDH1/2-mutant cancer cells.
   - The increased enzymatic activity of SIRT1, an NAD+-consuming enzyme, in combination with NAMPT inhibition, can enhance the antiproliferative effect in patient-derived IDH-mutant cells.
   - The glycolytic inhibition mediated by 3-bromo-2-oxopropionate-1-propyl ester (3-BrOP), along with carmustine (BCNU), shows a dramatic effect in killing GSCs.
   - Dual treatment with RTV plus BCNU increases the overall survival in the GL261 murine tumor model.
   - High GLUT1 expression is detected in quiescent endothelial cells.
   - The loss of GLUT1 in endothelial cells impairs brain angiogenesis in vivo without altering BBB physical functions.
   - Pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial components, mutant IDHs, and lipids is also being tested in ongoing clinical studies.
   - Dichloroacetate (DCA) induces ROS production, showing antitumor and antiangiogenic effects in C6 glioma cells in vivo.
   - As a pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibitor, DCA penetrates the BBB and normalizes mitochondrial functions in three of five GBM patients.
   - Mechanistically, DCA contributes to p53 activation and mitochondrial ROS generation.
   - The small molecule IACS-010759, an inhibitor of mitochondria complex I of the ETC, reduces tumor growth in mouse models of brain cancers and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
   - Ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, markedly suppresses GBM tumor growth via mitochondrial respiration inhibition.
   - Targeting tumor hypoxia by antiparasitic agents (ivermectin, proguanil, mefloquine, quinacrine, and atovaquone) is a promising approach for enhancing radiosensitivity.
   - Imipridone, also called ONC201, suppresses glucose metabolism and OXPHOS-dependent ATP production in stem-like GBM cells.
   - High levels of oxaloacetate have been shown to reduce glioma growth in animal models, and anhydrous Enol-Oxaloacetate (AEO) is being utilized to evaluate clinical response.
   - Targeting GLS enzymatic activity by CB-839 eradicates stem-like GBM cells.
   - Based on the preclinical finding, CB-839, combined with radiation and temozolomide, is being utilized in a phase 1 clinical trial of IDH-mutant astrocytoma.
