- **SESN2 (Sestrin2)**: SESN2 is a highly conserved protein that belongs to the sestrins family. It is expressed in mammalian cells in three isoforms: SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3. The article focuses on SESN2, which is found to be upregulated in glioma tumor tissues compared to normal samples. The study also reveals that higher SESN2 expression is associated with significantly lower overall survival rates in glioma patients.

- **5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 7 (HTR7)**: HTR7 is mentioned in the context of glioma, where it may play a role in the interaction pathway of the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway.

- **5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor 2A (HTR2A)**: HTR2A is associated with glioma grade through neuroactive ligand receptor interaction.

- **Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1)**: GRM1 is involved in the interaction pathway of the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway in glioma.

- **Adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2)**: ADCY2 may contribute to glioma development through the calcium signaling pathway.

- **Calmodulin Binding Transcription Activator 1 (CAMTA1)**: CAMTA1 plays a vital role in the human nervous system and affects the prognosis of glioma.

- **Synaptic vesicular protein 2A**: This protein can be used as a predictor of the response of glioma patients to certain drugs.

- **Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein S17 (MRPS17)**: MRPS17 can promote tumor cell metastasis through the collagen-containing extracellular matrix pathway in gastric cancer.

- **HOXD-AS2**: HOXD-AS2 regulates the cell cycle and promotes glioma progression.

- **GRM1**: GRM1 is mentioned in the context of glioma, where it may play a role in the interaction pathway of the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway.

- **ADCY2**: ADCY2 may contribute to glioma development through the calcium signaling pathway.

- **CAMTA1**: CAMTA1 plays a vital role in the human nervous system and affects the prognosis of glioma.

- **Synaptic vesicular protein 2A**: This protein can be used as a predictor of the response of glioma patients to certain drugs.

- **MRPS17**: MRPS17 can promote tumor cell metastasis through the collagen-containing extracellular matrix pathway in gastric cancer.

- **HOXD-AS2**: HOXD-AS2 regulates the cell cycle and promotes glioma progression.

The article does not provide specific expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their direct mention in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting. However, the study highlights the potential of SESN2 as a prognostic biomarker and its association with immune cell infiltration in glioma, which could be relevant to immunotherapy strategies.
