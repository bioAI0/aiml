- **Antigens with strong expression on cancer cells:**
   - HLA-I restricted neoepitopes
   - HLA-II complex
   - EGFR
   - EGFRvIII
   - IL13RA2
   - CD276
   - CD133
   - αvβ3 integrin
   - Oncogenic EGFRvIII variant
   - IL13RA2
   - CD276
   - CD133
   - αvβ3 integrin
   - Oncogenic EGFRvIII variant

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - HLA-I restricted neoepitopes are the most commonly studied and are recognized by CD8+ effector and memory T cells, enabling T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
   - HLA-II complex is less effective in eliciting anti-glioma immune response due to the abundance of tumor-promoting GAMs and their inhibited antigen-presenting function.
   - EGFR and its oncogenic variant EGFRvIII are highly expressed in glioma cells and have been targeted in mouse models and clinical trials.
   - IL13RA2, CD276, and CD133 are also expressed in glioma cells and have been targeted in mouse models.
   - αvβ3 integrin is expressed in glioma cells and has been targeted in mouse models.

- **Mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - HLA-I restricted neoepitopes are the focus of most neoantigen discovery and vaccine development studies, as they can be recognized by CD8+ effector and memory T cells, enabling T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
   - HLA-II complex is less effective in eliciting anti-glioma immune response due to the abundance of tumor-promoting GAMs and their inhibited antigen-presenting function.
   - EGFR and its oncogenic variant EGFRvIII have been targeted in mouse models and clinical trials using CAR T cells.
   - IL13RA2, CD276, and CD133 have been targeted in mouse models using CAR T cells.
   - αvβ3 integrin has been targeted in mouse models using CAR T cells.
