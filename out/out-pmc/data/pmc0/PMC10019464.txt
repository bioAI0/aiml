- **Angiogenesis-related antigens:** Angiogenesis is a critical process in tumor growth and progression, and several antigens associated with angiogenesis are highly expressed on cancer cells. The angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, involved in angiogenesis, is associated with the risk of developing astrocytoma.

- **Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs):** TAAs are proteins or peptides that are overexpressed or uniquely expressed on cancer cells, making them attractive targets for immunotherapy. The B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) is associated with astrocytoma, and its abnormalities are observed in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. The BRAF V600E mutation is the most common BRAF mutation in astrocytoma, and its expression is higher in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma compared to other astrocytomas.

- **Immune checkpoint molecules:** Immune checkpoint molecules are crucial in regulating immune responses and are often overexpressed on cancer cells, leading to immune evasion. The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) are immune checkpoint molecules that have been targeted in immunotherapy for various cancers, including astrocytoma.

- **Cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47):** CD47 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed on many cancer cells, including astrocytoma. CD47 blockade has shown efficacy in vitro and in animal models of glioblastoma, but clinical trials have not yet been conducted.

- **Cluster of differentiation 73 (CD73):** CD73 is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine, which has immunosuppressive effects. CD73 is overexpressed in various cancers, including astrocytoma, and its targeting is being explored as a potential immunotherapy approach.

- **Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2):** IDH1 and IDH2 are enzymes involved in cellular metabolism, and their mutations are associated with various cancers, including astrocytoma. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are prognostic markers in gliomas, and therapies targeting IDH1-specific mutations are being investigated.

- **O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT):** MGMT is a DNA repair protein that is overexpressed in some cancers, including astrocytoma. MGMT methylation is associated with improved patient outcomes in astrocytoma treatment, and its inhibition enhances the efficacy of temozolomide, a chemotherapeutic agent used in astrocytoma treatment.

- **Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3):** STAT3 is a transcription factor that is often activated in cancer cells, promoting tumor growth and progression. STAT3 inhibition has shown efficacy in preclinical models of glioblastoma, and its targeting is being explored as a potential immunotherapy approach.

- **Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A):** VEGF-A is a key regulator of angiogenesis and is overexpressed in various cancers, including astrocytoma. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes VEGF-A, has been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma and is being investigated in combination with other agents.

- **Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1–4 (FGFR1–4):** FGFR1–4 are receptor tyrosine kinases that are overexpressed in various cancers, including astrocytoma. Erdafitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FGFR1–4, is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of high-grade astrocytoma.

- **Mutated form of IDH1 and IDH2:** Mutated forms of IDH1 and IDH2 are associated with astrocytoma, and potential therapeutics against astrocytomas with these mutations include AG-5198 and ivosidenib for IDH1, and enasidenib for IDH2.

- **B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF):** The BRAF V600E mutation is the most common BRAF mutation in astrocytoma, and its expression is higher in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma compared to other astrocytomas. BRAF V600E kinase inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, have shown efficacy in treating pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma but have limited application in other astrocytomas due to the low prevalence of the BRAF V600E mutation in high-grade astrocytomas.
