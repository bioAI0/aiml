I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
I have found the following information in the paper:

- IDH-wildtype glioblastoma: IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer that is characterized by the absence of mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes. This type of cancer is known to be more aggressive and have a worse prognosis than IDH-mutant glioblastoma.

- Antigens: The paper does not specifically mention any antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does discuss the use of advanced motor mapping techniques to identify two functional components of the primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with M1 gliomas. These techniques involve the use of high-frequency stimulation and the measurement of various neurophysiological parameters, such as motor threshold, MEP amplitude, and latency.

- Immunotherapy and tumor targeting: The paper does not discuss the use of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. However, it does mention the potential for the advanced motor mapping technique to be used as a tool to investigate M1 functional neuroplasticity, which could have implications for the development of new treatments for brain cancer.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or need additional information, please let me know.

- **IGFBP2:**
   - IGFBP2 is one of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) and is involved in lymphocyte proliferation.
   - It is expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and has been explored as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various autoimmune diseases.
   - IGFBP2 expression is associated with the survival of GBM patients, with higher expression predicting shorter survival.
   - The article suggests that IGFBP2 expression may be a useful marker for GBM prognosis.
- **NOD2:**
   - NOD2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including oral lichen planus, Crohn's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.
   - It is expressed at higher levels in activated/memory CD4+ T cells and has been proposed as a diagnostic and treatment target for certain diseases.
   - A prognostic model for GBM patients was constructed using 9 immune genes, including NOD2, which predicted shorter survival.
- **TCF3:**
   - TCF3 is a transcription factor that contributes to the proliferative phenotype in Burkitt lymphoma and promotes B-cell-restricted genes through E-box motifs.
   - It can promote the survival of Burkitt's lymphoma cells by activating B-cell receptor signaling and PI3K signaling pathways and modulating cell cycle regulators.
   - TCF3 also promotes survival in lymphoid cells.
- **TYRO3:**
   - TYRO3 is a protein-coding gene involved in the ERK signaling pathway.
   - Higher levels of TYRO3 expression are associated with decreased overall survival in patients with colorectal, hepatocellular, and breast cancers.
   - While TYRO3 has not been directly linked to GBM, its prognostic value in this context should be further investigated.
- **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**: EGFR is frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma, with amplification and overexpression associated with poor prognosis, especially in young patients. EGFR amplification is closely associated with wild-type IDH1/2, and EGFR overexpression is significantly elevated in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM samples. However, EGFR amplification is not a significant prognostic factor for IDH1/2-wild-type GBM patients.
- **LANCL2 (Lanthionine Synthetase C-Like 2)**: LANCL2 is a homologue of prokaryotic LanC, involved in lantibiotics synthesis. It is a receptor for abscisic acid, an endogenous mammalian hormone, and can increase tumor cell sensitivity to adriamycin. LANCL2 amplification is an independent prognostic factor for younger glioblastoma patients, but not for IDH1/2-wild-type GBM patients.
- **TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)**: TERT promoter mutation is found in approximately 80% of primary GBM patients and is associated with poor survival. However, there is no specific mention of TERT expression levels in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM.
- **TP53**: TP53 mutation is associated with glioblastoma, but there is no specific information about its expression levels in IDH1/2-wild-type GBM.
- **MGMT (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)**: MGMT promoter methylation is a prognostic marker in glioblastoma, but there is no direct correlation between MGMT expression and IDH1/2-wild-type status.

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the provided text. However, EGFR and LANCL2 are extensively studied in glioblastoma, and their amplification and overexpression are potential diagnostic and prognostic markers. TERT, TP53, and MGMT are also important molecular markers in glioblastoma with prognostic significance.
- Fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP) is a type II integral serine protease that is specifically expressed by activated fibroblasts.
- FAP is overexpressed in many tumor tissues, including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, lung, brain, intrahepatic bile duct, and ovarian cancers.
- FAP is a marker that is constitutively expressed on the mesenchymal cells of most epithelial solid tumors.
- FAP expression promotes tumor occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis, which worsens the patient’s condition and is associated with a poor prognosis.
- FAP-targeted drugs can exert curative effects in models of most solid tumors.
- Nanomaterials have been used to target FAP for diagnosing and treating tumors.
- Nanomaterials have special properties that produce quantum size, interface, and macroscopic quantum tunneling effects, which can induce different biological responses.
- Nanomaterials have high surface reaction activity, many active centers, high catalytic efficiency, and strong adsorption capacity, which may have broad applications in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors.
- Some fluorescently labeled nanomaterials also have a significant role in tumor diagnosis and treatment, particularly those emitting second near-infrared channel (NIR-II) region fluorescence.
- Fluorescence imaging in the NIR-II region is at the forefront of biomedical research due to its inherent advantages, including relatively lower tissue autofluorescence and higher spatiotemporal resolution.
- Certain nanomaterials are constructed out of materials that respond to enzyme activity, and consequently, turn on quenched fluorescence under the catalysis of enzymes to obtain clear images.
- Targeted drugs and nanodrugs based on antibodies to FAP have been developed.
- Early studies of monoclonal antibodies targeting FAP focused on identifying FAP and F19 without considering their potential therapeutic effects. However, radiolabeled F19 revealed high expression of FAP in tumors and metastases, with improved clinical symptoms, which supports potential diagnostic and therapeutic roles for antibodies targeting FAP.
- Cheng et al. reported that antibody treatment targeting FAP inhibits tumor growth. Specifically, they immunized rabbits with recombinant mouse FAP and collected the resulting serum with FAP-specific antibodies. Treatment with this serum significantly inhibited the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines transplanted into nude mice.
- Specific anti-FAP antibodies and single-chain variable fragments (scFv) against FAP were subsequently developed, and the results revealed that the human single-chain fragments (scFv18 and scFv34) have greater affinity and lower immunogenicity, relative to F19.
- As macromolecular antibodies cannot easily enter solid tumors and produce a curative effect, Schmidt et al. constructed a bivalent FAP-specific antibody through targeted selection and reported an increased affinity for tumor tissue and human-derived VL and VH chains.
- Results from a phase I clinical study and pharmacokinetic analysis of the humanized anti-FAP antibody (sibrotuzumab) further revealed that it is well tolerated in humans and is specifically concentrated in the tumor stroma, with limited absorption in normal tissues.
- Millul et al. described a ligand with ultra-high affinity for FAP (OncoFAP) that is used for precise diagnosis and treatment of FAP+ tumors. Through the addition of fluorescein, which facilitates quantification of drug aggregation, they observed that 10 minutes after intravenous injection of OncoFAP, more than 30% of the drug had accumulated in 1 g of the tumor, maintaining a high concentration for at least 3 h, ensuring a long diagnostic time window. Furthermore, certain drugs can be tagged with fluorescein, allowing for simultaneous treatment and diagnosis.
- Ruger et al. combined liposomes containing DY-676-COOH with antibodies of FAP (scFv) to prepare anti-FAP liposomes (anti-FAP-IL). After the synthesis, the fluorescence of near-infrared fluorescent dyes in the aqueous solution within the liposomes was quenched, and only FAP-expressing cells were able to take up and activate fluorescence, which improves the diagnostic accuracy of the tumor.
- Li et al. reported a nanoparticle-based photodynamic therapy involving a photosensitizer (ZnF16Pc) encapsulated in a ferritin nanocage. The nanocage was conjugated with scFv to permit FAP targeting, and phototherapy was then used to eliminate the targeted cells. Targeting CAFs effectively treated tumors in mice. An analysis of intratumoral aggregation at different nanoparticle sizes revealed that nanoparticles in the tumors had enhanced permeability and retention, although most nanoparticles were distributed in the area around blood vessels and did not migrate to the tumor’s center. This was largely related to the physical barrier that was created by the dense tumor extracellular matrix, which prevented effective nanoparticle extravasation and diffusion. Thus, targeting and eliminating CAFs promotes the aggregation of nanoparticles in the tumors.
- Zhen et al. evaluated a similar nano-photoimmunotherapy strategy using drug-bearing nanocages conjugated with scFv to target FAP, which effectively eliminated CAFs through phototherapy with negligible damage to healthy tissues. Although this method did not directly target cancer cells, it effectively reduced tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Further studies revealed that targeting CAFs leads to decreased CXCL12 release and decreased extracellular matrix deposition, which reduces the barrier to T-cell infiltration and facilitates greater tumor inhibition. Thus, targeting FAP in this context might help regulate the tumor microenvironment and permit a more effective anti-tumor immune response.
- Lang et al. built a CAF-targeted siRNA delivery system by loading FAP antibodies onto cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-based nanoparticles. The nanoparticles can specifically down-regulate the expression of CXCL12 in CAFs, significantly inhibiting tumor cell invasion and migration, and tumor angiogenesis.
- Due to the special morphology of nanomaterials, more antibodies are attached to the surface, which improves the possibility of binding to FAP and greatly enhances the targeting ability.
- Prodrugs and nanodrugs based on FAP dipeptidase activity have been developed. The general structure of the prodrug is Z-Gly-Pro-Drug. It has a small molecular weight, and its toxicity is lower than that of the original drug. It exerts its effect after hydrolysis of the FAP-positive site.
- Diagnosis based on the high expression characteristics of FAP in tumor tissues, fluorescent probes and combined prodrug probes that respond to FAP enzyme activity have been designed to diagnose tumors. The use of the above probes has been only tested in animal tumor models for the time being.
- Han et al. developed a nanodrug with FAP endonuclease as a switch based on polydopamine-coated gold nanostar (GNS@PDA). This nanoplatform can essentially perform computed tomography/photoacoustic/two-photon luminescence/infrared thermal four-modality imaging. Under the precise guidance of multi-mode imaging, GNS@PDA performs uniform photothermal ablation of large solid tumors. These results show the great potential of this scalable nanoplatform related to FAP in cancer treatment.
- Ji et al. developed nanocarriers containing FAP cleavable peptides. These particles can hold drugs or fluorescent dyes and can release loaded drugs and fluorescent dyes under the action of FAP endonuclease, so they can be used as drug delivery platforms and cancer tissue imaging tools. Due to the high loading rate of nanodrugs, in most cases, integrated diagnosis and treatment research will likely be carried out, which can achieve the effect of killing two birds with one stone.
- Zhao et al. constructed a near-infrared probe based on FAP reactive peptides, which spontaneously form a large quantity of nanofibers on the surface of CAFs. In vitro imaging revealed that tumors were detectable at 24 h after probe administration and that the tumor group had a 5.5-fold greater signal than the control group. The probe provides a window of > 48 h for detecting a tumor and the selective probe assembly permits differentiation between tumors and organs with high metabolic activity, as the probe produces a tumor-specific signal that is 4-fold greater than the liver signal and 5-fold greater than the kidney signal. Moreover, the probe could specifically, and sensitively, diagnose small tumors with a diameter of approximately 2 mm.
- Therapies considering that FAP is overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment and generally absent in healthy adult tissues, some research groups have sought to use FAP protease activity to selectively activate prodrugs at tumor sites to improve effectiveness and reduce toxicity. Most candidates are prodrugs that are modified using nanotechnology, although they have not been tested in clinical trials. A mouse breast cancer model revealed that epirubicin conjugated with a FAP-specific dipeptide (Z-Gly-Pro) effectively releases epirubicin after incubation with FAP, and epirubicin induces a substantial anti-tumor effect in cells with high FAP expression (4T1). Furthermore, relative to free epirubicin, mice treated with this nanomaterial exhibit less weight loss with no obvious cardiotoxic effects. Other mouse and dog models have revealed that doxorubicin conjugated to a FAP substrate has significantly lower toxicity and greater safety relative to the toxic effects of free doxorubicin on the heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Moreover, the same dose of the doxorubicin-conjugated formulation is associated with a 2-fold increase in intratumor accumulation. In the clinical trial stage, it was found that Z-Gly-Pro-Dox is difficult to dissolve in water. Zhang et al. designed a nanomicelle system (ZGD-MNs) to promote the systemic administration of Z-Gly-Pro-Dox. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was used to evaluate its distribution in rats. The study found that ZGD-MNs are reasonably stable in phosphate buffer, showing good physical and chemical stability during the observation period of 2 weeks, and the cumulative drug release rate within 24 h was over 56%. Ji et al. have designed a new cleavable amphiphilic peptide that specifically responds to FAP on the surface of CAFs. The peptide spontaneously assembles into fibrous nanostructures in solution, which can easily be converted into drug-loaded spherical nanoparticles. These nanoparticles break down in response to FAP activity, resulting in rapid and effective drug release at the tumor site.
- Deep delivery of nanodrugs in tumor tissues the performance of many anti-cancer drugs is largely hindered by insufficient penetration. However, the variability of the particle size in nanomedicine allows for better dispersion and infiltration after entering the tumor tissue. In addition, targeting FAP to induce CAFs damage can also increase the penetration depth of the drug in the tumor tissue. Hou et al. have proposed a self-assembling FAP-triggered drug delivery system composed of peptide-crosslinked cationic polyaminoamine dendrimers. The chemotherapeutic drug (docetaxel) is conjugated to the peptide-crosslinked cationic polyaminoamine through disulfide bonds and electrostatic interactions and also coupled to hyaluronic acid to improve tumor targeting and biocompatibility. The nanoparticles have a diameter of approximately 200 nm and negative zeta potential, which permits stable circulation in the blood. However, when exposed to FAP, the nanoparticles dissociate and release the chemotherapeutic drug, which can penetrate CAFs and tumor cells. Studies have confirmed that the nanomaterial has good penetration of tumor-related biological barriers while killing a large number of tumor cells and a smaller number of CAFs. This effect is associated with a good therapeutic effect in hyperplastic solid tumors in connective tissues. Yan et al. have previously designed a light-triggered large-size nanoparticle. The FAP-α-targeting peptide was modified on the surface to increase the targeting of tumor tissue. After the photodynamic reaction, the large particles decomposed into small nanoclusters, which enhances drug delivery. The photodynamic response simultaneously induces CAFs apoptosis and breaks the physical barrier that affects deep tumor delivery. Another study revealed that CAFs are closely associated with local angiogenesis while targeting FAP+ CAFs and administration of vascular disrupting agents that kill perivascular cells are associated with a less stable blood-tumor barrier and greater killing of tumor cells. Chen et al. examined how this mechanism used vinblastine combined with a FAP substrate, which significantly reduced the growth of HepG2, A549, HeLa, and CNE-2 xenograft tumors. Both of these treatments rely on drug delivery through dipeptidase activity, which can kill CAFs and weaken the extracellular matrix, subsequently enhancing local drug accumulation. These strategies have good tumor specificity and therapeutic effects in a variety of solid tumor models.
- Conclusion and future direction FAP is a marker that is constitutively expressed on the mesenchymal cells of most epithelial solid tumors. There is increasing understanding that expression of FAP promotes tumor occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis, which worsens the patient’s condition and is associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, our understanding of the physiological effects of FAP expression has expanded to include its effects on the activation of tumorigenic signals, angiogenesis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and even immunosuppressive functions. Thus, there is interest in FAP as a potential target for anti-tumor treatments, and existing research suggests that FAP-targeted drugs can exert curative effects in models of most solid tumors. Although some drugs have been evaluated in clinical studies, drug instability and systemic side effects have limited their application. Moreover, the complex interactions between the tumor microenvironment components have made it difficult to precisely determine the specific contribution(s) of FAP to tumor development. Although its clinical application is limited, nanotechnology is a promising field for addressing these issues by increasing drug delivery, solubility, and adsorption, which may promote greater tumor permeability and retention. Another option is targeted therapy, although there are limited data regarding the anti-cancer efficacy of drugs that solely target CAFs. Further research is needed to determine whether these drugs should be combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or even immunotherapy, as some researchers believe that simply eliminating CAFs might promote metastasis by de-stabilizing the extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor. Therefore, substantial work is needed to continue advancing our understanding of treatments targeting FAP and their anti-tumor effects. Building prodrugs on the basis of nano-platforms has absolute advantages in both fluorescence imaging capabilities and drug loading; coupled with its passive targeting effect (enhanced permeability and retention effect, EPR) and deep delivery to tumor tissues, both of these greatly increase the accumulation of drugs in tumor tissues and reduce the concentration of prodrugs in non-target organs in the body. The structure of nanomaterials is relatively stable, reducing the possibility of accidental release in the circulation. To date, most nanomedicine remains in the research phase. The preparation of most nanodrugs is complicated while the synthesis conditions are strict, therefore, nanomedicine cannot be mass-produced. Furthermore, most nanodrugs used in medicine use materials with good biocompatibility, such as proteins and peptide chains. These materials are extremely easily degraded in the body and, even if they show good results in vitro, reactions may be slowed down in the complex environment of the organism, and some side effects may occur. Therefore, although nanomaterials have many advantages, there remain many unknown parameters that require further study, but we believe that nanomedicine will significantly improve disease treatment.

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a serine protease that is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are found in most epithelial tumors. FAP is also overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, as demonstrated by Röhrich et al. in their study.
- The study by Röhrich et al. investigated FAP and FAPI-PET/CT in gliomas in vitro, in vivo, and in a clinical study including 18 glioma patients (five IDH-mutant gliomas and 13 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas). The study determined elevated levels of tracer uptake in high-grade gliomas but not in low-grade IDH-mutant gliomas, potentially enabling a non-invasive diagnostic distinction.
- Windisch et al. evaluated the above-mentioned IDH-wildtype glioblastomas regarding their usefulness for radiotherapy or biopsy planning. Compared with MRI, FAPI-PET/CT scans lead to increased gross tumor volumes (GTVs), thus changing radiation treatment fields.
- The expression of FAP in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas is associated with tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. However, the exact role of FAP in tumorigenesis is unknown.
- FAP influences angiogenesis, presumably based on its enzymatic activity, and is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is eventually required for the development of metastasis by enabling migration and invasion.
- FAP is only overexpressed by activated fibroblasts, suggesting that CAFs play a major role in cancer growth.
- The overexpression of FAP in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas is associated with a poor prognosis.
- EGFR: EGFR overexpression and/or mutations play a central role in cell division, migration, adhesion, differentiation, and apoptosis. Genetic alterations in EGFR—including mutations, rearrangements, alternative splicing, and focal amplifications—are the dominant receptor tyrosine kinase lesions in GBM. EGFR deletions and point mutations that keep EGFR in an active conformation are found in 57% of GBMs. EGFR(△2–7) is characterized by a 267 amino acid deletion in the extracellular domain, which results in a receptor that cannot bind ligand and is constitutively active. EGFR(△2–7) is thought to represent a late event, occurring after EGFR-wildtype amplification. EGFR amplification and EGFR(△2–7) mutations might represent concerted evolutionary events that drive the aggressive nature of GBM by promoting invasion and angiogenesis via distinct signaling pathways.
- EGFR amplifications have been reported to indicate a much more aggressive tumor subpopulation. Aibaidula et al. reported patients with EGFR-amplified LGGs had significantly shorter OS than those with EGFR non-amplified tumors (median OS 1.03 y vs. 2.67 y, p = 0.003). Labussière et al. suggested that the influence of EGFR status on prognosis could be more complicated; patients with EGFR amplifications had a better prognosis in the TERT-mutated context than patients with TERT-wildtype tumors. On the other hand, EGFR-wildtype GBM patients had longer survival with TERT-wildtype than patients with EGFR-wildtype and TERT-mutated. Zou et al. showed that EGFR amplification and IDH mutations are mutually exclusive. Therefore, further research is required to determine their multi-genic interaction.
- In LGG, EGFR mutations indicate increased lesion infiltration of specific immune cell types and a poor prognosis. EGFR(△2–7) confers a growth advantage to GBM, and patients with EGFR(△2–7) mutations have significantly shorter survival. EGFR(△2–7) overexpression in the presence of EGFR amplification is the strongest indicator of a poor prognosis.
- On top of that, in WHO CNS5 EGFR gene amplification is one of the criteria to upgrade IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic tumor in adults to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype.
- In summary, currently EGFR-targeting drugs do not prolong OS and PFS, but intensive research for new types of drugs is ongoing.

I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on temporal muscle thickness (TMT) as a potential prognostic marker in glioblastoma, but it does not discuss antigens or their expression levels in different cancer types. Additionally, there is no mention of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in the context of these antigens.

The paper mentions that VEGF is commonly expressed in adult glioblastomas and is responsible for increased vascularity, tumor progression, and infiltration. Anti-VEGF therapy, such as bevacizumab, is frequently used in adult glioblastomas but is less effective in children due to the relatively infrequent expression of VEGF in pediatric glioblastomas.
- **PD-L1**: Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a protein that plays a role in immune checkpoint inhibition. The paper mentions that 75-100% of gliomas in a sample of patients exhibited PD-L1 expression, which correlated with the severity of the disease.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR
- MDM4
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as targets for treatment. For example, the paper states that "EGFR-mutated IDHwt gliomas were suggestively enriched in the later-onset cohort," and that "CDKN2A methylation was also significantly associated with later-onset LIHC (FDR = 1.40E-5) and SKCM (FDR = 0.017), and suggestively associated with later-onset THCA (FDR = 0.057) and BRCA (FDR = 0.069)."

The paper also provides information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. For example, it states that "EGFR-mutated IDHwt (FDR = 7.03E-10) and IDH1-mutated IDHmut-codel gliomas (FDR = 0.020) were both significantly enriched in later-onset cases," and that "CDK2NA methylation was also significantly associated with later-onset LIHC (FDR = 1.40E-5) and SKCM (FDR = 0.017), and suggestively associated with later-onset THCA (FDR = 0.057) and BRCA (FDR = 0.069)."

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR (including EGFRvIII mutation)
- PTEN
- TP53

These antigens are mentioned in the context of radiogenomics, which is the study of the relationship between imaging features and genomic characteristics of tumors.

The paper also mentions that these antigens are associated with specific radiographic phenotypes, which can be used to stratify patients into different risk groups based on their radiomic features. However, there is no specific information provided about the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- **HLA-I**: The study found no significant difference in the expression levels of HLA-A, B, or C between HMP and NHMP samples in either IDH-mutant or IDH-wildtype tumors. This suggests that HLA expression is unlikely to be the cause of the different correlation of TMB and immune scores in IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype gliomas.

- **Antigen Processing and Presentation (APP)**: The APP score was significantly higher in NHMP samples compared to HMP samples in IDH-wildtype tumors, but higher in HMP samples versus NHMP in IDH-mutant gliomas. The APP score also had a statistically significant correlation with immune score in gliomas. These data indicate that APP function is different between HMP and NHMP samples with different IDH mutation status but correlates with immune score in the sample cohort.

- **Immunosuppressive Genes**: The study analyzed the expression of well-known immunosuppressive genes and found that PD1 and PDL1 showed a statistically significant difference in expression between NHMP and HMP samples in IDH-wildtype gliomas. This suggests a potential therapeutic role of targeting PD1/PDL1 in IDH-wildtype gliomas.

It is associated with poor prognosis and is a potential target for immunotherapy. The study mentions that EGFRvIII is a GBM-specific antigen and suggests that it could be used as a biomarker for prognosis.

- **MGMT:** MGMT is a DNA repair enzyme that is often methylated in glioblastoma, leading to impaired DNA repair and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. The study highlights the importance of MGMT as a prognostic marker, especially in combination with other factors like IDH1 and MGMT promoter methylation status.

- **miR-21 and miR-10b:** These are microRNAs that are upregulated in glioblastoma and have been proposed as potential biomarkers for prognosis. The study suggests that these microRNAs are associated with the stemness of cancer cells and could be used for tumor targeting.

The study does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it emphasizes the importance of these antigens in glioblastoma and their potential as targets for immunotherapy and tumor targeting strategies.

- **VEGF-A**: This antigen is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is a key player in the angiogenesis process. It is also implicated in the mobilization of endothelial precursor cells and is associated with the histological grade of the tumor. VEGF-A is upregulated in the pseudopalized necrotic region of glioblastoma, primarily driven by the HIF family.

- **VEGFR2**: VEGFR2 is the main receptor mediating the physiological and pathological effects of VEGF, favoring the survival and proliferation of GECs. It is also involved in the vascular normalization process, which leads to an increase in tumor perfusion and oxygenation.

- **Angiopoietin 1 and 2**: These proteins bind to the Tie2 receptor with opposite effects. Angiopoietin 1 activates it, while angiopoietin 2 inhibits it. The activation results in vascular stabilization and permeability decrease, which are vital processes for vessel development in the sane patient. Angiopoietin 2 is particularly overexpressed in glioblastoma and favors the formation of immature vessels at the beginning of angiogenesis. It also has a pro-inflammatory activity that leads to the recruitment of myeloid cells, which are involved in neovascularization and the formation of perivascular and hypoxic niches.

- **DLL4**: This molecule is present in glioblastoma but not in glioma cells, demonstrating the importance of the neo-angiogenic activity in these grade IV tumors. DLL4 is involved in the differentiation of the precursor of the ECs, which can become either a tip cell or a stalk cell. It causes the overexpression of the adjacent Notch receptors, leading to the differentiation into stalk cells due to the interaction with VEGF-A.

- **Notch 1 and 4**: These receptors are recognized on the EC membrane and are vital in determining differentiative pathways of the precursor of the ECs. Notch, together with VEGF, is essential in determining differentiative pathways of the precursor of the ECs, which can become either a tip cell or a stalk cell.

- **YAP-Hippo axis**: This pathway is involved in the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), a vital process for neoplastic cells to develop an invasive phenotype. Metformin suppresses this axis, leading to a decrease in EMT markers in GSCs and the suppression of both mRNA and protein levels of Vimentin in favor of E-Cadherin. The molecular effect is on the YAP-Hippo axis, which induces EMT. By phosphorylating YAP, metformin prevents it from moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and avoids its activity as a transcription modulator in gliomas, thus lowering the activity of all the downstream molecules and decreasing its pro-EMT activity.

- **CLIC1**: This protein shows a functional expression, meaning that it is expressed only when it must act to allow the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. The transient activation of the channel allows metformin to bind the Arg29 domain (on the outer layer of the membrane), stabilizing the close state or obstructing the channel. Analysis on mRNA revealed a correlation between glioblastoma malignancy and expression of CLIC1. In detail, this correlation is present in both human glioblastoma and experimental models. However, because the downstream pathway of the channel is not known yet, it is not clear what is the purpose of these metformin effects, and more studies should be conducted to deepen the investigation.

- **CD133**: This marker is used in in vitro models to recognize GSCs, but it is well known that, because of the plasticity of these cells, these markers are not always expressed. Metformin treatment demonstrated a reduction of cell growth only in CD133+ compared to CD133- and a lack of proliferation in human stem cell.

- **IGF-receptor**: The food uptake determines the increased liver cell expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), IGF-receptor, and insulin-receptor. This, in turn, leads to the activation of a signal transduction starting from the insulin receptor substrate (IRS), involving the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt (PKB, protein kinase B) and inactivating the TSC Complex Subunit 2 (TSC2), known as a tumor suppressor. The activation of mTOR as an indirect result of the signal transduction inhibits TSC2 and promotes cell growth and proliferation. Several studies reported that cancer risk and progression are associated with mTOR activation. Therefore, it is plausible that metformin's anti-cancer effects are associated with the inhibition of mTOR activity.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- PD-L1
- CTLA-4

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy, with the paper stating that high-risk patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma would benefit more from potential immunotherapy due to higher expression of checkpoint genes, such as PD-L1 and CTLA-4.

The MGMT promoter status is determined by pyrosequencing, and patients are divided into methylated and unmethylated groups based on the average methylation level.

The paper also highlights the importance of distinguishing treatment-induced responses, such as pseudoprogression and radionecrosis, from true progression for subsequent clinical decision-making and prognosis assessment. Advanced imaging techniques, such as MR spectrum (MRS), perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), and PET, are used to distinguish these responses.

In terms of expression levels across different cancer types, the paper does not provide specific information on the expression levels of these antigens in other cancer types. However, it does mention that IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is one of the most lethal malignancies and exhibits high molecular, temporospatial, and radiological intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity. The authors also discuss the importance of considering non-contrast-enhancing tumors in glioblastoma research, as these tumors can also progress rapidly and evolve into contrast-enhancing tumors.

The paper does not provide information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the use of an oncolytic adenovirus that targets fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in the tumor stroma, which is highly expressed in various types of cancer. This approach aims to deplete stromal cells expressing FAP and potentially improve the efficacy of cancer treatment.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)

The above antigens are highly expressed on cancer cells, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and are mentioned in the context of tumor targeting and immunotherapy. FAP is a type II membrane-bound glycoprotein belonging to the DPP4 family, and its expression is associated with the regulation of the extracellular matrix. FAP is co-expressed with DPP4 in various tissues, including the alpha cells of Langerhans islets, multipotent bone marrow stromal cells, and the cervix and uterine stroma during the proliferative cycle.

The article discusses the development of FAP-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, such as 68Ga-FAPi-02 and 68Ga-FAPi-04, which have shown promising results in tumor imaging and radioligand therapy. These radiotracers bind to the enzymatic domain of FAP with high specificity and are rapidly internalized, leading to high intratumoral uptake and improved diagnostic performance in PET imaging. The use of chelators, such as DOTA, allows for the incorporation of therapeutic isotopes, enabling a theranostic approach.

The article also mentions the potential of FAPi-PET in the detection of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and its role in radiotherapy planning. FAPi-based PET/CT may be useful for non-invasive characterization of gliomas and their malignant progression, as elevated tracer uptake has been observed in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and WHO grade III/IV IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Additionally, FAPi-PET-based gross tumor volumes (GTVs) have shown significant increases compared to MRI GTVs, indicating the potential for improved target volume delineation in radiotherapy planning.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

It is involved in the conversion of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is an active oncopromoter lipid with pleiotropic functions in cancer. In the context of glioblastoma, SPHK1 has been found to be highly expressed in fast-proliferating glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), where it contributes to the rapid degradation of newly synthesized ceramide (Cer) and the increased flux of Sph to S1P. This results in a 10-fold higher release of S1P in the extracellular milieu compared to slow-proliferating GSCs. SPHK1 is also upregulated in glioblastoma endothelial cells (GECs) when co-cultured with glioblastoma cells, leading to increased S1P secretion and stimulation of glioblastoma cell growth and GEC migration and tubule formation.

The paper does not provide specific information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it mentions that the "sphingolipid rheostat," which involves the balance between ceramide and S1P, is a potential target for cancer therapy. The paper also discusses the role of sphingolipids, particularly S1P, in the tumor microenvironment and their contribution to cancer progression.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper mentions that the "sphingolipid rheostat" and the enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism and signaling could be potential targets for cancer therapy. The paper also discusses the potential of metformin as an anti-cancer add-on therapy, suggesting that it could be used in combination with other targeted therapies to enhance their efficacy.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- CD133: CD133 expression is associated with a shorter time to distant recurrence and is greater in SVZ+ tumors (determined by imaging) than in SVZ- tumors.
- GFAP: GFAP is a marker for the glial fibrillary acidic protein expressed by astrocytes and ependymal cells during development. It is also upregulated in GBM.
- Nestin: Nestin is an intermediate filament protein that is expressed by neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and is generally recognized as a marker of undifferentiated nervous system cells.
- SOX2: SOX2 is an HMG-Box transcription factor that is expressed in neural progenitor cells and is considered a marker of high pluripotency.
- Vimentin: Vimentin is a protein overexpressed in GSCs and NSCs, and it is implicated in various cancers, including GBM.

Regarding their expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that CD133 expression is associated with a shorter time to distant recurrence in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. GFAP is upregulated in GBM, and vimentin is overexpressed in GSCs and NSCs, indicating its potential oncogenic alteration of a normal NSC process.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, the paper does not provide any specific information about these antigens. However, it is worth noting that the paper discusses the role of the SVZ in GBM and the potential for developing novel and effective therapeutic interventions using a combination of models.
- CD161-encoding gene KLRB1: This antigen is expressed by a population of cytotoxic TILs in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Inactivation of KLRB1 or antibody-mediated CD161 blockade resulted in increased T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro and an enhanced response in vivo.
- HER2, IL-13Rα2, and EphA2: These antigens are being targeted by bi- or tri-CAR T-cell approaches in murine models of GBM.
- Survivin: A vaccine approach targeting the oncoprotein survivin has had moderate success in recurrent GBM and warrants further exploration of other vaccine targets. Survivin is an antiapoptotic protein expressed by many tumor types, including GBM. Its expression in GBM has been associated with increased recurrence, chemotherapy resistance, and poor overall prognosis. The SurVaxM vaccine contains a synthetic long peptide mimic that spans the human survivin protein sequence; it expresses MHC Class I epitopes and stimulates the MHC Class II-restricted T-cell responses required for cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell activity against tumors. A Phase I trial of SurVaxM against recurrent GBM demonstrated no serious adverse events and prolonged overall survival following vaccination (86.6 weeks) compared with historical overall survival (30 weeks). A subsequent study identified that glioma patients routinely expressed elevated serum levels of CD9+/GFAP+/SVN+ exosomes, associated with tumor progression, compared with healthy controls. Patients treated with antisurvivin therapy showed decreased levels of these exosomes. Monitoring of CD9+/GFAP+/SVN+ exosomes may be a promising adjunct to the use of MRI in disease surveillance. Current trials are underway to evaluate SurVaxM’s efficacy in newly diagnosed GBM.
- EGFRvIII: This antigen is targeted by CAR T-cell therapy in EGFRvIII-positive recurrent glioblastoma. Although EGFRvIII-targeted CAR T-cells found their way from peripheral blood to the tumor, no meaningful response was detected. This lack of response to anti-EGFRvIII CAR T-cells may be attributable to the significant intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of EGFRvIII expression in glioblastoma as well as to adaptive changes in the local TME, which include changes in antigen expression over time. For instance, following treatment, EGFRvIII was lost in a group of patients.
- IDH1: A vaccine targeting mutant IDH1 in newly diagnosed glioma has shown promising results, with vaccine-induced immune responses observed in 93.3% of patients and no regime-limiting toxicity observed. The 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 63% and 84%, respectively. The 2-year progression-free rate among patients with an immune response was 82%, while the two patients without an immune response had tumor progression within 2 years of diagnosis.
- Cancer germline antigens: These are non-mutated targets with low expression levels in glioblastoma.
- Neoantigens: Only a few mutation-derived neoantigens have been predicted in glioma.
- Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP): This antigen is mentioned in the context of immunohistochemical analysis, where it is positive in the patient's case, indicating a glial neoplasm.

- IDH1 R132H: The article discusses the negative immunohistochemical analysis for IDH1 R132H, which is consistent with a wild-type ("de novo") glioblastoma. The absence of IDH1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis and a mean survival of 10-15 months.

FDOPA uptake occurs through both LAT1 and LAT2, but LAT2 is more selectively transported through LAT2.

- LAT1 and LAT2 are both involved in the uptake of amino acid tracers, which are used for the diagnosis of glioma recurrence. However, LAT1 is more widely expressed on tumor cells, while LAT2 is more tumor-selective. FDOPA uptake occurs through both transporters, but LAT2 is more selectively transported through LAT2.

- LAT1 and LAT2 are both involved in the uptake of amino acid tracers, which are used for the diagnosis of glioma recurrence. However, LAT1 is more widely expressed on tumor cells, while LAT2 is more tumor-selective. FDOPA uptake occurs through both transporters, but LAT2 is more selectively transported through LAT2.
