I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- EGFR: EGFR amplification is more prevalent in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, particularly in the NT-2 cluster, compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. EGFR is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies in various cancers, including glioblastoma.
- CDKN2A/B: These genes are frequently deleted in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, especially in the NT-2 cluster. CDKN2A/B deletions have been implicated in tumorigenesis and are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
- TERT promoter mutation: The TERT promoter mutation is more common in IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, particularly in the NT-2 cluster, compared to IDH-mutated gliomas. TERT promoter mutations have been associated with tumor progression and are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and their expression levels are compared across different glioma subtypes. While the paper does not provide detailed information on their expression across different cancer types, it highlights their relevance in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting for glioblastoma.

The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
- CDKN2A/B
- SOX-2
- Nestin

The MGMT promoter methylation is a molecular marker used in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, specifically for prognostication and clinical decision-making. The MGMT promoter methylation is present in approximately 80% of WHO grade 2 and 35–45% of WHO grade 3 and 4 gliomas. The MGMT gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed repair enzyme that removes alkyl groups from guanine in the DNA. If the MGMT enzyme is active, it can remove the O-6′ methyl groups introduced by TMZ-chemotherapy, partly repairing the DNA and reducing its therapeutic impact. The downregulation of its expression by the methylation of its promoter is thought to increase TMZ efficiency.

The IDH mutation is a molecular profile that distinguishes IDH-mutant astrocytomas from IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Tumors with a mutation of IDH have a molecular profile and thus an origin distinct from IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. This is supported by evidence that tumors previously diagnosed as IDH-wildtype astrocytomas corresponding to WHO (2016) grades II or III actually represent IDHwt glioblastoma and are now classified as such, while former IDH-mutant glioblastomas have been renamed into IDH-mutant astrocytomas (CNS WHO grade 4) to reflect a distinct lineage. These tumors are defined by having morphological high-grade features (necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation) and/or the presence of CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion.

The SOX-2 and Nestin antigens are mentioned in the context of immunofluorescence staining to identify stem-like glioma-initiating cells. These cells are believed to play a major role in tumor initiation and recurrence and are thought to be particularly resilient. The strong co-expression of SOX-2 and Nestin in all specimens before and after treatment, regardless of treatment group and cell line, indicates that the stem-like cell characteristics of all three cell lines were not altered by the treatment.

The CDKN2A/B antigen is mentioned in the context of the 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumors, which defines IDH-mutant astrocytomas (CNS WHO grade 4) as having morphological high-grade features (necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation) and/or the presence of CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their specific roles in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - TNC (Tenascin-C)
   - C1RL (Complement C1q Receptor-Like)
   - FABP5 (Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5)
   - CSTA (Cystatin A)
   - BCL3 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3)

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - TNC: Highly expressed in glioblastoma, especially in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
   - C1RL: Upregulated in glioblastoma, particularly in mesenchymal and primary glioblastoma.
   - FABP5: Correlated with an undifferentiated tumor phenotype in glioblastoma.
   - CSTA: Upregulated in human malignant gliomas, especially in invasive GBMs.
   - BCL3: Overexpressed in various cancers, including breast cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, endometrial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer.

- **Mentions in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:**
   - TNC: Printed peptide arrays identified prognostic TNC serum antibodies in glioblastoma patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker.
   - C1RL: C1RL-associated genes are enriched in immune response processes, and C1RL expression is correlated with reduced tumor purity and increased M2 macrophage infiltration in glioblastoma.
   - FABP5: A known tumor-associated antigen that can respond to B cells.
   - CSTA: CSTA-positive cells are located close to tumor blood vessels and inflammatory host cells in GBM tumor samples, indicating its potential role in the tumor microenvironment.
   - BCL3: BCL3 expression promotes resistance to alkylating chemotherapy in gliomas. In ovarian cancer, BCL3 induces immune checkpoint PD-L1 expression, mediating cancer cell proliferation.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- TERT promoter
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B
- MTAP
- TP53
- EGFR
- PTEN
- NF1
- BRAF
- PDGFRA
- CDK4
- PIK3CA

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as therapeutic targets for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The study also highlights the clinical actionability of these antigens, meaning the probability of being able to receive appropriate molecular targeting therapeutic agents.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it does mention that the frequency of genomic aberrations for FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 is lower than other MAPK-activating genes such as EGFR and PTEN, but the total proportion of mutations in the FGFR family is not negligible. This suggests that pan-FGFR inhibitors might be an effective treatment for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.

Additionally, the paper discusses the potential of using the comprehensive genomic profiling test (CGPT) to detect driver genomic aberrations, enabling glioma patients to participate in clinical trials and the categorization of these patients based on the WHO 2021 classification. The authors emphasize the importance of considering CGPT in the early clinical courses of patients with glioblastoma, given the limited standard treatment options and high recurrence rate.

I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
The paper does not provide specific information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the EGFRvIII antigen in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting. The EGFRvIII antigen is a mutated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is commonly found in glioblastoma and other cancers. The paper discusses a clinical trial (NCT02122822) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of a peptide vaccine called rindopepimut, which targets the EGFRvIII antigen. The trial showed a possible long-term survival benefit for GBM patients with significant residual disease who received rindopepimut compared to those with minimal residual disease. The authors suggest that residual disease is associated with greater antigen expression, leading to enhanced anti-tumor immunity required for a therapeutic effect.

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which involves engineering T cells to target specific antigens on cancer cells. While the paper does not provide details about the specific antigens targeted in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, it highlights the importance of residual tumor burdens in generating an effective immune response in immunotherapies such as CAR-T therapies.

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- IDH-wildtype glioblastomas show elevated tracer uptake in fibroblast activation protein-specific PET/CT.
- FAP is highly expressed in the stroma surrounding more than 90% of epithelial-derived tumors and their metastases and is consistently expressed in bone and soft tissue tumor cells.
- FAP is one of the specific markers of CAFs in TME and is closely related to tumor invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and prognosis and is considered an essential target for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.
- FAP is highly expressed on the cell surface of high-grade gliomas (excluding diffuse astrocytomas).
- Clinical studies have shown high uptake of FAPI imaging agents in high-grade gliomas (SUVmax = 2.8 ± 0.6), whereas low-grade gliomas showed only mild uptake (SUVmax = 0.35 ± 0.10).
- FAP imaging agents may be helpful in the detection and target area sketching of high-grade gliomas in the brain, non-invasive grading of gliomas, and assessment of prognosis after radiotherapy.

The paper does not provide any information on antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP): This antigen is highly expressed on the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of the tumor stroma in various tumor entities, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. FAP contributes to tumor progression and a worse prognosis. It is a promising biomarker and target for medical interventions, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs): CAFs are a heterogeneous cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and their presence is associated with resistance to immunotherapy in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CAFs can have different origins, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, resident tissue fibroblasts, and adipocytes.
- Integrin b1/CD29, α-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), PDGFR-β (platelet-derived growth factor receptor β), CAV1 (caveolin 1), and S100-A4/FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1): These markers are used to classify CAF subpopulations (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1 (CAF-S1 FAP+), which is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2): HER2 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. HER2 expression is associated with a poor prognosis and is a target for immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor): EGFR is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. EGFR is a target for immunotherapy and targeted therapy.
- CXCL12β (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12β) and CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4): These molecules are involved in the initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and distant metastatic processes in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CXCL12β is secreted by CAF-S1, and CXCR4 is expressed in cancer cells.
- PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) and PD-L2 (programmed cell death ligand 2): These ligands are expressed by CAFs from various cancer types, including IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. They are targets for immunotherapy, including anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-L2 immunotherapies.
- GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1): GLUT1 expression is commonly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with an inability to express an EMT phenotype.

The paper also mentions the following in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting:

- CAF-S1 FAP+ promotes an immunosuppressive environment by secreting CXCL12β, increasing T cell survival, and promoting the differentiation of CD25+FOXP3+ cells.
- CAF-S1 FAP+ is associated with resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and reduces antitumor immunity.
- CAFs from IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and other cancer types have shown expression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2, particularly the CAF-S1 FAP+ subset.
- The CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation is an important source of CXCL12 secretion, which plays a crucial role in resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer.
- Targeted CAF therapy can potentially inhibit metastasis and cancer progression by reducing immunosuppression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment.
- The dynamic behavior of FAP is associated with its functions in the progression phase during cancer evolution, including tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, promotion of tumor proliferation, and immunomodulation.
- Additional clinical studies are needed to define the clinical impact of the non-invasive in vivo detection of FAP in newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients and its implication in determining candidates for immunotherapy and target therapy combined with conventional therapies.
- **Antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:**
   - Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9)
   - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α)
   - Nestin
   - Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1)

- **Expression levels across different cancer types:**
   - CA9: Widely expressed in perinecrotic tumor cells, particularly in recurrent glioblastomas.
   - HIF-1α: Expressed in tumor cells around sites of necrosis and also found in tumor cells not directly adjacent to necrotic areas.
   - Nestin: Expressed in many glioblastomas, with downregulation associated with differentiation.
   - FOXM1: Overexpressed in glioblastomas and upregulated in recurrent glioblastomas at both mRNA and protein levels.

- **Immunotherapy and tumor targeting:**
   - The study investigates the potential of FOXM1 as a biomarker for survival during anti-VEGF therapy, suggesting that it may be a marker for proliferating glioma stem cells (GSCs) and a prediction biomarker for survival.
   - The authors also discuss the role of vascular co-option as a mechanism of resistance to antiangiogenic treatment, which may be exploited by recurrent glioblastomas to escape anti-VEGF therapy.
   - The study highlights the importance of understanding the TME and its impact on tumor dormancy, as well as the potential of combining Bevacizumab with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- gp96 (glucose-regulated protein 96): Overexpressed in grade IV gliomas, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. Its expression is associated with increased malignancy and worse clinical outcomes. gp96-selective inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies are under development as potential treatments.
- HSP90 (heat shock protein 90): gp96 belongs to the HSP90 family, and its expression is associated with various malignancies, including gliomas.
- GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein): Used as a marker for glioma cells in the study.
- CD4, CD8, and PD-1: These immune cell markers are used to assess T cell infiltration in gliomas. Their densities are associated with clinical outcomes and can be influenced by gp96 expression.
- IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase): A mutation status used to classify gliomas, with IDH-wildtype glioblastomas showing higher gp96 expression and worse outcomes.

The paper also discusses the potential of using gp96-peptide complexes as a vaccine (HSPPC-96 vaccine) to treat various cancers, including glioblastoma. The vaccine has shown promising results in early clinical studies, and the authors suggest that understanding the impact of gp96 expression and its association with immune cell infiltration could provide insights into vaccine immunity and help identify responsive patients.
- **FGFR3-TACC3 fusion**: This fusion is found in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and is associated with characteristic histopathological and molecular features. It is a potential target for targeted therapy, with anlotinib showing promising results in a case report.
- **PDK1**: PDK1 is a hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1 regulated gene that may promote EGFR activation, sustaining malignant progression. Inhibiting PDK1 can greatly inhibit glioma cell colony and sphere formation and sensitize glioma spheres to temozolomide toxicity.
- **CD2**: CD2 is a transmembrane molecule expressed on T, natural killer (NK), and dendritic cells, essential for immunology. It is involved in tumor invasion and is highly expressed in breast cancer.
- **COL5A1**: COL5A1 is related to the occurrence and progression of multiple types of malignant tumors, including breast cancer and gliomas. It is positively correlated with the increasing malignancy of glioblastoma through the PPRC1-ESM1 axis activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and it may be a potential therapeutic target for glioma.
- **PBK**: PBK expression is associated with cell growth and apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and immune responses, playing an essential role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. It is found to be upregulated in GBM patients, and its inhibition can almost completely abolish tumor growth, making it a potentially promising therapeutic target for GBM treatment.
- **FANCA**: FANCA is associated with tissue proliferation and is found to be overexpressed in many types of cancers. Targeting the FA pathway may provide a novel strategy for the sensitization of solid tumors and investigation of chemoresistance in different tumor types.
- **ANXA7**: ANXA7 is a ubiquitinated tumor suppressor gene. Loss of ANXA7 function stabilizes the EGFR protein, augments EGFR transforming signaling in glioblastoma cells, and promotes tumorigenesis.
- **TACC3**: TACC3 is often mentioned with FGFR3-TACC3 fusion, an oncogenic driver. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions generate powerful oncogenes that combine growth-promoting effects with aneuploidy through the activation of as yet unclear intracellular signaling mechanisms. FGFR inhibition has shown encouraging outcomes in mouse studies, and targeting FGFR3-TACC3 fusion is evaluated by many ongoing early-phase human clinical trials.
