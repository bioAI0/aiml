- VISTA: This antigen is a member of the CD28 receptor family and is mainly expressed on myeloid and granulocytic cells, including naive T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs, but not on B cells. Through the interaction with an unknown receptor on T cells, VISTA negatively inhibits T cell responses: not only T-cell proliferation, but also the expression of activation markers and the production of cytokines. In vitro, VISTA induces the development of Tregs with the help of TGF-β. In line with its biological activities, VISTA-KO mice are resistant to the development of GL261 glioma. In addition, when combined with a cancer vaccine, VISTA blockade inhibits tumor growth. In a glioma mouse model, GL261 cells were directly injected into the left cerebral hemisphere of WT or VISTA-KO mice, and the tumor growth was monitored and recorded using an imaging technique system all the time. WT mice tumors died within 35 days after GL261 inoculation, while no tumor developed in approximately 20% of VISTA-KO mice. Therefore, targeting VISTA may present potent therapeutic efficacy on glioma.

The study found that HOXD4 expression was significantly higher in WHO grade IV gliomas (glioblastoma) than in grade III gliomas, and that high HOXD4 expression was associated with shorter survival in glioblastoma patients.

The paper also discusses the potential of HOXD4 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma, but it does not provide information on the expression levels of HOXD4 across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention the following antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting:

- **IDH-mutant tumor cells**: The paper discusses a vaccine developed against IDH-mutant tumor cells, which is currently being tested in a clinical trial. This vaccine aims to destroy cells expressing a mutant protein.
- **MGMT promoter methylation**: The paper highlights the importance of MGMT promoter methylation as a biomarker indicating a benefit from treatment with a specific alkylating agent, temozolomide. MGMT is a DNA repair protein, and its promoter methylation is associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival in patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide.
- **BRAF V600E mutation**: The paper mentions that BRAF V600E mutations are found in a range of low-grade IDH-wildtype glial and glioneuronal tumors, as well as in malignant variants. Inhibitor drugs interrupting the BRAF/MEK component of the MAP kinase pathway have been developed and trialled in both malignant and low-grade BRAF V600E mutant brain tumors.
- **Histone H3.3 K27M mutation**: The paper discusses histone H3.3 K27M mutations, which are highly specific and considered as "driver" mutations in high-grade gliomas. These mutations lead to a global reduction of trimethylated H3K27, and the level of trimethylation at this residue is regulated by the methylating enzyme EZH2 and the de-methylating JMJD3. Experimental preclinical studies have shown that targeting these enzymes could be a potential treatment strategy for histone-mutant gliomas.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
- TERT (Telomerase reverse transcriptase): TERT is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) and is associated with increased TERT transcripts and upregulation of TERT mRNA. TERT promoter mutations are selectively observed in IDH-wildtype GBM, and the presence of these mutations is well-correlated with distinctive glioma groups. The study suggests that TERT could be a good therapeutic target against IDH-wildtype GBM, and a specific TERT-targeting therapy might be a promising strategy.
- ATRX (Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked gene): ATRX is mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype GBM, as it is associated with telomere length and TERT upregulation. The study suggests that ATRX loss could be a contributing factor in upregulating TERT protein expression.
- IDH1/2 (Isocitrate dehydrogenase genes 1 and 2): IDH1/2 mutations are mentioned in the context of IDH-wildtype GBM, as they are associated with the classification of diffuse gliomas.

- S-100 protein: S-100 protein is another antigen with strong expression in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as evidenced by the case study. S-100 proteins are a family of low-molecular-weight proteins found in various tissues, including the brain, and are often used as markers for neural tissue. The paper notes that neoplastic cells exhibited diffuse reactivity for S-100 protein, further supporting their glial origin.

- Ki-67: Ki-67 is a nuclear protein associated with cellular proliferation, and its expression is often used as a marker for tumor aggressiveness. In the case study, the Ki-67 proliferative index was markedly elevated, indicating a high-grade, aggressive lesion. While the paper does not explicitly state that Ki-67 is an antigen, it is commonly used as a target for immunohistochemistry and may be considered an antigen in this context.

- BRAF V600E: The BRAF V600E mutation is a specific genetic alteration that results in the expression of a mutated BRAF protein. Approximately 50% of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas harbour this mutation, and it is also observed in some melanomas. The paper discusses the potential therapeutic implications of BRAF inhibitors for tumors with this mutation, suggesting that BRAF V600E could be a target for immunotherapy or tumor-targeted therapy.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting beyond the potential implications of the BRAF V600E mutation.

It is also reported as a cancer stem cell-specific marker and its increased expression is associated with higher histological grade in glioma patients. Nestin expression is positively correlated with tumor recurrence and glioma cell infiltration into intact brain tissue. In the paper, nestin staining was used to discriminate between patient-derived fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells in ring co-culture experiments.

- **Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)**: Although GFAP is not exclusively expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, it is mentioned in the paper that GFAP can also stain fibroblasts, which is in accordance with observations made by others.

- **Homeobox Protein C9 (HOXC9)**: Overexpression of HOXC9 in breast cancer cell lines resulted in increased invasiveness but inhibited proliferation, suggesting a potential role in the "go or grow" concept. However, the exact mechanisms and downstream targets responsible for its effects on proliferation and invasion are still unknown.

- **Y-box Binding Protein-1 (YB-1)**: Enforced expression of YB-1 in non-invasive breast epithelial cells induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to an enhanced metastatic potential while reducing proliferation. Similar to HOXC9, the mechanisms behind YB-1's dual role in proliferation and invasion are not fully understood.

I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text. The paper focuses on genetic and epigenetic analysis of astrocytomas, and while it does mention IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, it does not provide any details about antigens or their expression levels in this specific cancer type.
- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor): EGFR is mutated or amplified in 35–45% of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and is implicated as a key driver. However, gliosarcoma, a histologic variant of glioblastoma, does not exhibit amplification or mutations of EGFR at the same frequency, suggesting there may be additional/alternate mechanisms propelling tumorigenesis and potentially mesenchymal transition into a sarcoma phenotype. The study found that EGFR amplification is uncommon in gliosarcoma, but frequent gain of chromosome 7 (72%) containing the EGFR locus was observed. It is important to note that amplification or mutation of EGFR is not necessarily required for EGFR activation. For example, copy number gain of SYNJ2 in breast cancer leads to EGFR activation by altered trafficking pathways. Therefore, even though EGFR amplification is not common in gliosarcoma, EGFR pathway activation may still be present.

The study found that DKK1 is considered to be a negative regulator of the WNT pathway and has been implicated as a candidate gene that is epigenetically silenced in medulloblastoma. Loss of DKK1 may provide an avenue for WNT pathway activation with subsequent cell proliferation and survival.

- NF-kß (nuclear factor kappa B): NF-kß is a protein complex that controls DNA transcription and can induce cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis if misregulated or constitutively activated. Aberrant activation of NF-kß in glioblastoma has been reported, leading to cell invasive capabilities, resistance to radiotherapy, and even promotion of mesenchymal phenotype. Studies have been published to evaluate the therapeutic effect of inhibition of NF-kß based on these mechanisms. The study found that there is copy number loss in the region encoding for NF-kß in gliosarcoma, implying that activation of the NF-kß pathway does not play a role in gliosarcoma genesis. However, it is possible that loss of NF-kß could lead to loss of DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in neoplasia.

- TCF7L2 (TCF4): TCF7L2 is a protein that is involved in the WNT signaling pathway and is frequently mutated or amplified in various cancers, including glioblastoma. The study found that several regions that showed chromosome loss were areas that coded for TCF7L2.

- The study found that carnosine significantly increased PDK4 expression in both U87 and T98G glioblastoma cell lines, while the PI3K inhibitor Ly-294,002 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin also increased PDK4 expression in U87 cells.
- The authors hypothesized that carnosine's anti-neoplastic effect may be mediated by an influence on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, as PDK4 expression is regulated by transcription factors downstream of this pathway.
- However, reporter gene assays revealed no specific effect of carnosine on the human PDK4 promoter, suggesting that carnosine's effect on PDK4 expression is independent of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.
- The study also found that carnosine reduced cell viability in both U87 and T98G cells, while rapamycin and Ly-294,002 had no significant effect on cell viability.
- The authors concluded that carnosine's anti-neoplastic effect is independent of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and suggested that further investigation of its mechanisms of action and consideration for therapy is warranted, especially given its natural occurrence and lack of side effects in the treatment of other diseases.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of PDK4 across different cancer types or its mention in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2)**: IGFBP2 is a protein that binds to and regulates the activity of insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II. It is frequently overexpressed in glioblastomas and is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor survival. The text highlights that IGFBP2-driven tumors are dependent on the continued expression of IGFBP2, and its knockdown leads to decreased tumor progression and prolonged survival. IGFBP2 is also overexpressed in the stem cell compartment of glioblastomas, contributing to tumor progression by enriching for glioma stem cells and boosting their survival. The article suggests that IGFBP2 could be a potential therapeutic target, and neutralizing antibodies against IGFBP2 have been shown to impair oncogenic signaling pathways and inhibit tumor cell spread.

- **Platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFB)**: The text mentions that IGFBP2 collaborates with PDGFB in the development of glioma, but does not provide specific expression levels across different cancer types or discuss its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **O(6)-methyl guanidine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)**: MGMT promoter methylation is mentioned as a biomarker of interest in glioblastomas, but the text does not provide information on its expression levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma or its role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- **Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)**: TERT promoter mutations are discussed in the context of molecular subgroups of glioblastomas, but the text does not specify its expression levels in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma or its relevance to immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
- Nogo-A: Nogo-A is a myelin protein that is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is primarily responsible for inhibiting cell migration. It contains two inhibitory domains that bind to distinct cell surface receptors: the Nogo66 domain binds to the Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), and the Δ20 domain binds to the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). Both receptors are strong activators of Ras homolog A (RhoA). The Δ20 domain of Nogo-A is a conserved disordered region that can adopt different conformations to interact with different binding partners. This flexibility enables Nogo-A to bind to both S1PR2 and SPARC, a matricellular protein that modulates the cellular microenvironment and is secreted by cells under stress conditions.
- SPARC: SPARC is a matricellular protein that is strongly expressed in highly invasive gliomas. It is secreted by glioblastoma cells in response to RhoA activation and is required for their ability to invade the white matter of the healthy brain. SPARC competes with S1PR2 for binding to an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the Nogo-A-Δ20 domain, acting as a decoy to attenuate the activation of inhibitory RhoA signaling via S1PR2. SPARC production is regulated by a novel RhoA-induced signaling mechanism that involves the deactivation of the ribonuclease IRE1α, which abolishes SPARC mRNA decay and allows glioma cells to secrete SPARC.
- S1PR2: S1PR2 is a receptor for Nogo-A that is expressed in established glioblastoma cell lines and in patient-derived low-passage glioblastoma cells. It is activated by the specific receptor agonist CYM-5520 and can be attenuated by the receptor antagonist JTE-013. S1PR2 is transactivated by the Δ20 domain of Nogo-A, mainly via its third extracellular loop, and is required for the induction of SPARC production in glioblastoma cells.
- NgR1: NgR1 is a receptor for Nogo-A that is not expressed by glioblastoma cells. Its expression is reduced in invasive glioma cell lines and human glioma tissues, with decreasing expression as malignancy increases.
- IRE1α: IRE1α is a kinase/endoribonuclease that regulates SPARC translation in a mechanism called regulated Ire1-dependent decay of messenger RNA (RIDD). It is deactivated by RhoA-induced signaling, which abolishes SPARC mRNA decay and allows glioma cells to secrete SPARC. The RNase activity of IRE1α is required for SPARC production, and its phosphorylation increases its RNase activity.
- ENTPD5: ENTPD5 is an ER-resident enzyme that enables a high protein folding capacity of the ER by sustaining UDP-glucose levels. It is transcriptionally upregulated by activated AKT signaling and is required for the production of SPARC in glioblastoma cells with high p-AKT1 levels. Inhibiting AKT1 phosphorylation or disturbing the enzymatic function of ENTPD5 prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production.
- PTEN: PTEN is a tumor suppressor protein that is often functionally inactivated in highly invasive gliomas. PTEN re-expression reduces p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels and prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production. However, not all PTEN-positive glioblastoma cells have low p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels, and WT PTEN expression in LNT229 glioblastoma cells is responsible for their low p-AKT1/ENTPD5 levels.
- AKT1: AKT1 is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is constitutively active in highly invasive gliomas. It is often upregulated in gliomas due to genetic alterations of PI3K or PTEN. AKT1-driven ENTPD5 expression is required for glioblastoma cells to produce SPARC. Inhibiting AKT1 phosphorylation or re-expressing PTEN prevents RhoA-induced SPARC production.

The article does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types.
- **Collagen alpha-1(VI) chain (CO6A1)**: This protein is up-regulated in glioblastoma and down-regulated in normal tissues. It accumulates and forms deposits in perivascular tumor tissue and in pseudopalisading cells, suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis.
- **Neuron-glial-2 (NG2)**: This transmembrane chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan is up-regulated in glioblastoma and associated with a poor clinical outcome. It promotes drug resistance through PI3K/AKT survival signaling.
- **Annexin A2 (ANXA2)**: This protein is a candidate biomarker for malignant gliomas and is directly involved in angiogenesis-dependent invasion through the up-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
- **Polymerase 1 and transcript release factor complex (PTFR)**: This protein is involved in the metabolic pathways of tumor cells and is associated with the chemoresistance of glioblastoma to imatinib. It is expressed in both glioblastoma tissue and serum exosomes, and its silencing has been shown to suppress glioma progression in a murine model.

These antigens are specifically mentioned in the context of glioblastoma, and their expression levels in other cancer types are not discussed in the provided text. Additionally, there is no mention of these antigens in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Nestin: Nestin is a protein that is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and is often used as a marker for these cells. In the paper, nestin is used to identify potential tumour progenitor cells (pTPCs) in primary glioblastoma cells. The authors found that 98% of the primary glioblastoma cells were nestin-positive/GFAP-negative pTPCs, indicating a high level of expression of nestin in these cells.

- GFAP: GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) is a protein that is highly expressed in astrocytes and is often used as a marker for these cells. In the paper, GFAP is used to identify differentiated cells in primary glioblastoma cells. The authors found that only 2% of the primary glioblastoma cells showed GFAP positive staining, indicating a low level of expression of GFAP in these cells.

  - The study by Bockmayr et al. demonstrated a positive correlation between infiltrating T cells, defined by a gene signature consisting of 10 mRNA expression levels, and overall survival in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
  - The study by Ladomerski et al. showed that depletion of CD8+ T cells at a late time-point during tumorigenesis and treatment in a syngeneic murine glioma model leads to a loss of treatment effect, while CD4+ T cells were indispensable at every time-point.

- **Olig2**: A transcription factor that is highly expressed in diffuse gliomas and pilocytic astrocytomas. It is also a significant marker for glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly therapy-resistant and play a major role in tumor recurrence and invasion. The study found that higher expression of Olig2 was associated with significantly shorter overall survival in the univariate analysis of the patient cohort at the 5% and 10% cut-offs, but statistical significance was lost in the multivariate analysis.
- **Nestin**: A type VI intermediate filament that is mainly expressed in precursor neurons and identified as a marker for glioma stem cells. The study found that Nestin expression has no independent prognostic impact in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.
- **Nogo-A**: A neurite outgrowth inhibitor that was successfully utilized for the differentiation of oligodendrogliomas from other gliomas. The study found a heterogeneous expression of Nogo-A in glioblastoma, but no correlation with age, clinical status, MGMT-promoter methylation status, or overall survival.
- **AQP4**: A highly regulated water channel protein in the central nervous system that is frequently expressed in glioblastoma and is associated with glioma invasion and migration. The study found no differences in age, clinical status, MGMT-promoter methylation, or prognosis at different expression cut-offs.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.

- O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
- Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
- Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2-A)

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the paper discussing their potential as targets for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The paper also highlights the importance of understanding the molecular diversity of glioblastoma and its implications for any potential therapy, including immunotherapy.

Regarding expression levels across different cancer types, the paper mentions that MGMT is found in 35%–45% of high-grade gliomas and is associated with a better response to chemotherapy. PTEN mutations are observed in a significant subset of glioblastoma, and EGFR amplification is also a common molecular genetic alteration associated with glioblastoma. However, the paper does not provide specific expression levels for these antigens across different cancer types.

- **CD70**: CD70 is a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, particularly in the epithelioid glioblastoma and gliosarcoma variants. It is also overexpressed in recurrent tumors and tumors with MES gene signatures of GBM, and plays a role in promoting tumor migration. Ablation of CD70 in glioblastoma cells reduced genes correlated with tumor epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as SOX-2 and CD44, and inhibited the migration and growth of the tumor. Targeting CD70Pos glioblastoma cells with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T-cells) triggered a strong antitumor response, suggesting that CD70 is a promising tumor immunotherapeutic target in GBM.
- **CD133**: CD133 is a CSCs marker associated with cancer progression and tumorigenesis in various tumors, including gliomas. In glioblastoma, overexpression of CD133 has been linked to CSCs’ self-renewal and resistance towards temozolomide (TMZ) by the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and Notch/sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathways. CD133Pos cells populations were found to be highly associated with aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1), another putative marker that promotes poor prognosis and chemoresistance.
- **CD44**: CD44 is a large cell adhesion molecule that acts as a receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA), a major element of the extracellular matrix. It is expressed with the highest expression of 55.55% in GBM. CD44 cleavage and secretion take place at a massive rate on the leading edge of the tumor, and standard CD44 (sCD44) was discovered in the opposite hemisphere of the brain, indicating that sCD44 is capable of propagating or circulating in the brain. sCD44 was shown to activate abnormal Tau pathology features, which indicates that sCD44 plays a pathological role between glioblastoma and neurodegeneration. Elevated levels of CD44 are present within the invaded location at the tumor margin, and GSCs with greater expression of CD44 in the tumor margin in comparison with the center correlates with highly invasive feature, shorter survival, and faster tumor progression.
- **CD15**: CD15 is a trisaccharide 3-fucosyl-N-acetyllactosamine, and is widely known as stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1). It has been confirmed to be prominently upregulated in various types of neutrophils and macrophages, and in several cancers. In the adult brain, CD15 was shown to be remarkably expressed on pluripotent SCs and neural stem cells (NSCs), where it is believed to play a role in cell–cell interaction throughout neuronal growth. PN subtype GSCs significantly express CD15 at the cell surface along with CD133. The expression proportion of CD15 was found to be upregulated in non-CSCs under hypoxic conditions, and hypoxia actually induced sphere formation in glioblastoma-sorted non-CSCs and those newly formed spheres are highly expressed in SC markers, including CD15. This indicates that CD15Pos GSCs can be stimulated throughout dedifferentiation under a hypoxic environment, and this interchange between non-GSCs and GSCs perhaps promotes the cancer to become more malignant.

- **FHOD1 (formin homology domain containing protein 1)**: FHOD1 is frequently expressed in glioblastoma tissue, with moderate/high expression in 84% of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cases. The expression of FHOD1 is not uniform, and can be higher in infiltrating cells than in the tumor bulk. The study suggests that the moderate/high expression of FHOD1 in a subset of glioblastomas can be considered as overexpression, as it is not expressed in brain parenchyma, although it is present in endothelial cells in the brain. However, not all glioblastomas express immunohistochemically detectable amounts of FHOD1, indicating that its expression is not crucial for glioblastoma invasion. FHOD1 has been found to be upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, and participates in migration/invasion in vitro.

- **INF2 (inverted formin 2)**: INF2 is frequently expressed in glioblastoma tissue, with moderate/high expression in 46% of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cases. The expression of INF2 is not uniform, and can be higher in infiltrating cells than in the tumor bulk. The study suggests that the moderate/high expression of INF2 in a subset of glioblastomas can be considered as overexpression, as it is expressed at low levels in glial cells according to the human protein atlas. However, not all glioblastomas express immunohistochemically detectable amounts of INF2, indicating that its expression is not crucial for glioblastoma invasion. INF2 has been found to be upregulated in basal-like breast cancer, and is associated with basal markers and functional activities.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types, nor does it mention them in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
I'm sorry, I was unable to find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- EGFR: EGFR amplification is a common feature of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is associated with a worse prognosis. EGFR is a well-known target for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies in glioblastoma, and its expression levels can vary across different cancer types.
- PTEN: PTEN deletion is associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and its loss can lead to increased tumor growth and progression.
- CDKN2A: CDKN2A homozygous deletion is a strong adverse prognostic factor in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CDKN2A is a cell cycle regulator, and its loss can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.
- TERT: TERT promoter mutation is a common feature of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and it is associated with a worse prognosis. TERT is a telomerase gene, and its mutation can lead to increased telomerase activity and cell immortality.
- MGMT: MGMT promoter methylation is an important predictive marker in terms of response to alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, specifically in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. MGMT is a DNA-repair protein, and its expression levels inversely correlate with promoter methylation.
- CDK4/MDM2: CDK4 and MDM2 co-amplification is associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. CDK4 and MDM2 are cell cycle regulators, and their co-amplification can lead to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth.
- PIK3CA: PIK3CA mutations are associated with a worse prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. PIK3CA is a kinase involved in cell growth and survival signaling pathways.
- BRAF (V600E): BRAF V600E mutation is associated with a better prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. BRAF is a kinase involved in cell growth and survival signaling pathways, and its mutation can lead to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth.
- Chromosomes 19 and 20: Co-gain of chromosomes 19 and 20 is associated with a better prognosis in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Chromosome 19 and 20 gains can lead to increased expression of tumor suppressor genes and decreased tumor growth.

- **PSMA**: PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancer and has recently emerged as a target for radionuclide imaging and treatment of this tumour. PSMA is expressed not only in prostate cancer, but also in other solid tumours including brain tumours and correlates with the WHO grade. PSMA expression was found in endothelial cells associated with neovascularization and, for these reasons, can be a very interesting marker for monitoring anti-angiogenic drugs.
- **FAP**: FAP-positive signalling of extracranial tumours is attributed to activated Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) that are located in the stromal compound of these tumours and overexpress FAP. In parallel, patients underwent multimodal MRI. FAP specific PET and rCBV MRI scans are modestly correlated and no correlation between the FAP-based PET and the ADC sequence has been observed, suggesting that FAP-specific PET could be useful in biopsy organization and discrimination between pseudo-progression and tumour progression after radiation therapy for GBM imaging.
- **TSPO**: TSPO is a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, composed of a transmembrane multimeric protein complex of 18-kDa, situated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. TSPO is widely distributed in most peripheral organs. In addition, TSPO is also minimally expressed in resting microglial cells in the healthy brain but is substantially upregulated in reactive astrocytes and predominantly during the microglia activation process, due to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. Moreover, most glioma cells express the TSPO. Different studies demonstrated a positive correlation between TSPO expression and grade of malignancy and a negative correlation with survival. The most used TSPO radiotracer is [11C](R)PK11195. Su et al. found that [11C](R)PK11195 uptake in high-grade gliomas was significantly higher than in low-grade astrocytomas and low-grade oligodendrogliomas. TSPO in gliomas was expressed predominantly by neoplastic cells, and its expression correlated positively with uptake in the tumours indicating that [11C](R)PK11195 can be used to stratify patients. Considering the short half-life of 11C-labelled compounds, other new generations TSPO specific ligands have been developed, such as [18F]DPA-714 and [18F]GE-180. In a human glioma-injected mouse model, obtained after the injection in the brain of Gli36dEGFR-LITG, Zinnhardt et al. performed multi tracer imaging PET studies ([18F]FET, [18F]DPA-714, and [18F]BR-351, this last for MMPs) to evaluate the inflammatory tumour microenvironment. Authors found that the three radiotracers only partially overlapped; glioma cells overexpressed TSPO contributing to the most of [18F]DPA-714 uptake, but also infiltrating glioma associated myeloid cells (GAMs) showed an important TSPO and MMP expression. In another study performed in patients with glioma, authors found a strong relationship (r = 0.84, p = 0.009) between the [18F]DPA-714 uptake and the number and activation level of GAMs. TSPO expression was mainly restricted to human leukocyte antigen D related-positive (HLA-DR+) activated GAMs, particularly to tumour-infiltrating HLA-DR+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumour-associated macrophages indicating that TSPO radiotracer could be useful to study tumour microenvironment. At the same time, in a preclinical model obtained with human GBM cells from patient, [18F]DPA-714 was able to detect glioma infiltration into the contralateral brain earlier than [18F]FET. In parallel, DWI MRI provides microstructure information. Authors also found an abundance of CD11b+ GAMs inside and around the tumour. We have recently developed and characterised a new TSPO radiotracer, [18F]VC701 in neuroinflammation models. Similarly, in an orthotopic glioma model obtained with murine GBM cells, the GL261 ones, we observed an earlier TSPO uptake signal compared to [18F]FLT uptake (Figure 2). Furthermore, the radiotracer [18F]GE-180 seems to provide interesting results in patients and the uptake correlates with the grade of tumour. Other radiotracers are now under development to increase the specificity to TSPO.
- **MT1-MMP**: MT1-MMP or MMP-14 is another attractive biomarker for tumour therapy and imaging. MMPs are linked to increased cell proliferation, tumour invasion, migration, and poor prognosis in glioma patients. Moreover, MMPs facilitate microglia-mediated glioma invasion by degrading the basement membrane and proteins of the ECM. Besides that, MMPs affect the neuroinflammatory milieu by modulating the expression and activity of chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and receptor turnover. Several molecules have been recently developed to study MMPs. For example, de Lucas et al. evaluated an immunoPET tracer for the membrane-type 1 matrix metallo-proteinase (MT1-MMP or MMP-14), [89Zr]DFO-LEM2/15, in xenograft and orthotopic brain GBM models. This tracer displayed the higher uptake after 24 h post injection in tumours with high expression of MT1-MMP but a severe disruption of the BBB is needed to visualise intra brain tumours. Zinnhardt and colleagues, in a multiple tracers study to evaluate the inflammatory microenvironment in an orthotopic glioma model, used the MMP inhibitor compound (R)-2-(N-benzyl-4-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)phenylsulphonamido)-N-hydroxy-3-methylbutanamide ([18F]BR-351), which binds to the activated forms of MMP-2, -8, -9, and -13. Areas of exclusive [18F]BR-351 were observed at the outer borders of the tumour volume and the area of radiotracer uptake agreed with in situ zymography, indicating elevated levels of activated MMP-2 and MMP-9.
- **MMP-2/9**: Wang et al. synthesized a membrane-penetrating cyclic peptide, named iCREKA, labelled by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and positron emitter 18F. The cyclic peptide iCREKA reaches tumour tissues via blood circulation. CREKA is expected to specifically bind to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes that are widely and abundantly distributed in tumour stroma. MMP-2/9 recognize and cleave iCREKA between CREKA and the membrane-penetrating peptide, while hydrolytic enzymes hydrolyze the disulfide bond. As a result, the fluorescent or radionuclide-labelled membrane penetrating peptide is released, which enters the plasma membrane and the tumour cells. The microPET/CT imaging demonstrated that [18F]iCREKA could target U87MG xenograft tumour in vivo from 30 min to 2 h after injection.
- **MMP-14**: Zhao et al. investigated the biodistribution and uptake of [18F]-fluoropropionyl-chlorotoxin ([18F]-FP-chlorotoxin), which binds to MMP-2 in an orthotopic rat C6 glioma model. The uptake of the tracer in the normal brain is very low and a high accumulation was found in the glioma tissue. The tumour to normal brain ratio of [18F]-FP-chlorotoxin was higher than that of [18F]FDG with the maximum uptake at 90 min.
- **MMP-14**: Kasten and colleagues designed an MMP-14-activatable dual PET/NIRF peptide probe for imaging and guiding resection of glioma. The peptide probe combined (1) a NIRF reporter and quencher pair separated by a peptide sequence (MMP-14 “substrate peptide”) that is cleaved specifically by activated MMP-14 to release the quencher and allows visualization of the NIRF dye; and (2) a chelate for radionuclides attached to a peptide sequence, that binds to MMP-14 (MMP-14 “binding peptide”) and enables PET imaging. For PET imaging the peptide was labelled with [68Ga] or [64Cu] and biodistribution was evaluated in an orthotopic glioma model obtained with PDX JX12 tumour. Both [68Ga]binding-peptide and [64Cu]binding-peptide allow to visualize PDX tumours. PET and NIRF signals correlated linearly in the orthotopic PDX tumours and the signals co-localized with MMP-14 expression identified with immunohistochemistry.

I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)

FAP is overexpressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of several cancer entities, including IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. The article mentions that FAP expression in healthy tissue is relatively low.

In the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, the article discusses the potential of directly targeting CAFs, which are made visible by FAPI-PET, with a radiation boost. This approach is suggested as a new perspective for treatment because it not only targets the cancer more accurately but also sensitizes the entire tumor to radiation, chemo-immunotherapy, and the body's own immune system.

The article also highlights the potential of FAPI imaging in early response evaluation during and after therapy. PET tracers can visualize biological and molecular changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by radiotherapy, enabling the adaptation of treatment plans and personalization of follow-up regimens.

However, the article does not provide specific information about the expression levels of FAP across different cancer types or its role in immunotherapy. Further studies are required to evaluate the optimal threshold for FAP expression to specify precise tumor volume and reduce side effects of radiation therapy.
The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells. However, it does mention CD44 as a potential target antigen for immunotherapy or tumor targeting. CD44 is a cell surface adhesion receptor that is highly expressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma. The paper suggests that CD44 could be a promising target for immunotherapy or tumor targeting in glioblastoma, as it is upregulated in glioblastoma patients compared to healthy volunteers and plays a role in tumor progression.
- ATRX: The loss of ATRX expression was more frequent in TERTp wild-type GBM, but this difference was not significant.
- CD133: The expression of CD133 was associated with the pattern and timing of primary GBM recurrence. It was also significantly associated with multifocal lesions.
- p53: TP53 gene mutations and/or strong immunoreactivity of p53 were found in 43.4% of patients.
- Ki-67: The Ki-67 labeling index was determined by immunohistochemical staining, with a mean of 33.8% in the study population.
- MGMT: MGMT gene promoter methylation was found in 40.5% of patients and was associated with longer PFS and OS.

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting in this paper. However, they are known to be highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and are potential targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies.
- MET: The MET pathway can increase levels of VEGFA and VEGFR2 on endothelial cells and promote proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Activation of the HGF/MET axis prevents apoptosis through activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3 kinase) and subsequent AKT activation. Upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in GBM leads to the growth and survival of uncontrolled tumor cells through the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) that activates many cell survival and anti-apoptotic genes. Another dysregulated pathway is RAS. By activating this pathway, MET can induce other signaling pathways such as MAPK, allowing tumor cells to grow and survive. Upregulation of RTKs such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can affect multiple signaling pathways in GBM. It has been found that STAT3 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) have a role in the promotion of GBM cell invasion and migration.
- VEGFA: VEGFA is a key signaling pathway in medulloblastoma, as it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Activation of the pathway has widespread and multi-functional tumor-promoting effects. HGF-activated MET paracrine signaling on endothelial cells can enhance their angiogenic activity. In the context of medulloblastoma, MET activation leads to the expression of proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factor, which are known for their important roles in tumor promotion through angiogenesis.
- VEGFR2: Aberrant expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- PDGFRβ: Aberrant expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- ErbB1-4: Aberrant expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB1-4) has been found in ependymomas. Deregulated expression of RTKs and related growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, and PDGF can result in specific signaling that enhances tumor growth.
- HGF: HGF is a key tumor-promoting factor in the tumor microenvironment. It has been found to be overexpressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, and its expression often correlates with the malignancy grade of gliomas. The aberrant expression of MET in high-grade gliomas and embryonal brain tumors is associated with poor clinical outcomes. HGF binds to the receptor MET and induces several biological activities involved in cancer progression, such as growth, survival, motility, and metastasis.

- LBH (Limb-bud and Heart)
- SCARA3 (Scavenger Receptor Class A Member 3)

These antigens were found to be highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, as indicated by the study's results. LBH is directly regulated by HIF-1 and promotes angiogenesis in human brain microvessel endothelial cells through the VEGFA-mediated ERK signaling pathway under hypoxic conditions. SCARA3 mRNA is overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma compared with breast carcinoma effusions, and it promotes drug resistance in multiple myeloma.

The study also mentions that these antigens have been reported in previous research, suggesting their potential as targets for immunotherapy or tumor-targeting strategies. However, it does not provide specific information on their expression levels across different cancer types or their direct involvement in immunotherapy.
- EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)
- P53
- Ki-67

The paper discusses the expression of these antigens in the context of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with the following key points:

- EGFR expression was positive in 84.6% of the cohort, with no significant difference between local and non-local progression groups.
- P53 expression was positive in 68.2% of the cohort, with no significant difference between long-term and short-term survivors in the non-local progression group.
- Ki-67 index was high in 36.6% of the cohort, with no significant difference between local and non-local progression groups.

The paper does not provide information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types or their role in immunotherapy or tumor targeting.
- **Interleukin 13 receptor α2 (IL13Rα2)**: IL13Rα2 is a cell-surface receptor that is positively expressed in 82% of GBM samples and >70% of glioma stem-like cancer-initiating cells. It was previously thought to be directly associated with increased mesenchymal signature gene expression and poor patient survival. For the treatment of recurrent GBM, Christine et al. showed the first-in-human clinical experience for CAR-engineered IL13Rα2-specific CD8+ CTL and observed significant tumor regression.
- **Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII)**: EGFRvIII is a negative prognostic indicator expressed in about 25–33% of all patients with GBMs and is the most commonly mutated gene among the EGFR family in glioma. In EGFRvIII-expressing newly diagnosed GBM, a peptide vaccine targeting EGFRvIII (rindopepimut) was previously evaluated and found to be well-tolerated, providing immune responses with prolonged progression-free survival. More recently, O’Rourke et al. conducted a phase I safety study of autologous CAR T cells targeted to EGFRvIII (CART-EGFRvIII) in 10 patients with recurrent GBMs. Intravenous infusion of a single dose of CART-EGFRvIII cells was found to be feasible and safe, without off-tumor toxicity or cytokine release syndrome.
- **Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)**: Elevated HER2 expression has been reported in 41% of primary GBM samples and in 81.4% of GBM primary cell lines and was correlated with impaired survival. In preclinical models of GBM, bispecific CAR molecules that incorporated 2 antigen recognition domains for HER2 and IL13Rα2 showed the functional superiority of T cell expressing antigens ex vivo and in an orthotopic GBM xenograft model. However, the safety concerns of autologous CART-HER2 cells were raised by the report of a serious adverse event following the administration of 1×1010 T cells of vaccine based on trastuzumab. While administration of up to 1×106/m2 CART-HER2 cells showed no evident toxicities, unfortunately, the expansion and persistence of CART-HER2 cells was limited. To treat HER2-positive GBM, Nabil Ahmed et al. developed HER2-specific CAR-modified virus-specific T cells (CAR VS Ts-HER2) with an FRP5-based exodomain and a CD28.ζ endodomain. Up to 1×108/m2 CAR VS Ts-HER2 were infused intravenously without dose-limiting toxic effects in 17 patients with progressive GBM. After the infusion, CAR VS Ts-HER2 was detectable in the peripheral blood for up to 12 months, with no observed expansion in peripheral blood (but expansion at GBM sites). Of 16 evaluable patients, 50% of patients had clinical benefit, as defined by a partial response (N=1, over 9 months) and stable disease (N=7, 8 weeks–29 months). Despite the feasibility and safety of CAR VS Ts-HER2, a clinical strategy using it alone or in combination with other immunomodulatory approaches is warranted to improve the anti-GBM activity of CAR VSTs-HER2 by augmenting their expansion and persistence.

- Fibroblast activation protein α (FAP): FAP is a trans-membrane cell surface protein with serine peptidase activity, which is selectively expressed in activated or cancer-educated fibroblasts. It is one of the most commonly used and reliable CAF markers due to its selective expression in activated or cancer-educated fibroblasts, and functions to suppress anti-tumor immune cells, promote tumor growth, and drive epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Clinically, the abundance of FAP+ CAFs is associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer. FAP is considered a promising therapeutic target for cancer therapy, and strategies to target FAP+ CAFs include small molecule FAP inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and other immunotherapies.

- α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA): αSMA is a marker commonly used for CAFs, vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes. It is linked to a myofibroblast phenotype.

- Fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP1): FSP1 is a CAF marker that exhibits strong expression within the myeloid population in GBM.

- Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) α and β: PDGFRs are markers used to identify CAFs. PDGFRβ is a well-documented brain pericyte marker and is co-expressed with FAP in GBM-associated pericytes.

- Nestin: Nestin is a marker for primarily labeling GBM or stem/progenitor cells.

- IDH1 R132H: IDH1 R132H is a marker for neoplastic cells in IDH-mutant GBM.

- TGF-β1: TGF-β1 is a cytokine that is secreted by FAP+ cells in GBM and contributes to immunosuppression. It is also associated with the maintenance of GBM stem cells.

- Olig2: Olig2 is a marker for glioma/oligodendrocyte cells.

- GFAP: GFAP is an astrocyte marker.

- Ki67: Ki67 is a tumor proliferation marker.
