I have identified the following antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- CDKN2A
- EGFR

CDKN2A is a gene that encodes two tumor suppressors, protein p14ARF and p16INK4A. Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A can contribute to uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation and has been reported as a poor prognostic marker in adult glioma. CDKN2A homozygous deletion is also observed in pediatric gliomas, and is a well-known hallmark lesion of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. CDKN2A homozygous deletion co-occurs with the BRAF V600E mutation, demonstrating poor clinical outcomes.

EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently amplified and overexpressed in glioblastoma. It is a well-known oncogene that plays a critical role in the development and progression of glioblastoma. EGFR amplification and overexpression are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy.

In the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, CDKN2A and EGFR have been mentioned as potential targets for immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies. CDKN2A has been identified as a potential target for immunotherapy in glioblastoma, and EGFR has been targeted with monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors in clinical trials.

Predominantly the BBR2 is upregulated in cancer cells such as breast, lung, pancreas, colon, and prostate.
   - CCK is a peptide hormone that regulates various actions predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. It was initially characterized with a 33 AA sequence, but later, the peptide was shown to be present in more biologically active forms (e.g., CCK4, CCK8, CCK33, CCK39) derived from a 115 AA precursor. A total of three types of CCK receptors from the G-protein coupled receptors family have been identified, CCK1 known as CCK A, CCK2 known as CCK B, and CCK2i4sv receptor, respectively.

Its biological action is mediated through three classes of the G-protein-coupled receptors VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1. The receptors for VIP occur in numerous tumor cells, including thyroid, breast, lung, liver, pancreas, intestinal epithelial cells, colon, bladder, prostate, uterus, and neuroendocrine tumors.

The paper does not provide a list of antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells, nor does it mention any information on their expression levels across different cancer types. However, it does discuss the expression of certain antigens in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting.

The paper mentions the following antigens:
- O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
- Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
- Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
- Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
- Phosphate and tension homology on chromosome 10 (PTEN)
- Ki-67
- TP53

These antigens are not specifically mentioned in the context of immunotherapy or tumor targeting, but the paper does discuss their expression in glioblastoma and their potential role in distinguishing pseudoprogression from true early progression. For example, the paper states that MGMT promoter methylation status can predict the incidence and outcome of pseudoprogression after concomitant radiochemotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. The paper also mentions that the expression of EGFR, MMP-9, and VEGF is associated with tumor progression and that PTEN expression is associated with tumor suppression.

The paper does not provide any information on the expression levels of these antigens across different cancer types. However, it does mention that the expression of these antigens is associated with specific molecular and histological characteristics of glioblastoma, which could potentially be used to distinguish pseudoprogression from true early progression.
- B7-H3 (CD276): This antigen is highly expressed in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 14.07 (1.02) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 12.35 (0.87) in unmethylated cases. B7-H3 is a costimulatory molecule for T cell activation and IFN-γ production, and its expression is associated with lower overall survival in high-grade glioma.
- PD-L1: PD-L1 expression is significantly increased in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 11.50 (0.57) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 10.62 (0.58) in unmethylated cases. PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 on T-cells, potentially suppressing T-cell activation. Its expression is also associated with increased PD-L1 inhibitor (nivolumab) use in clinical practice.
- CD4: CD4 expression is significantly higher in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, with a mean normalised count of 11.22 (0.65) in the tumour core of methylated cases and 9.58 (1.01) in unmethylated cases.

I have identified the following antigens that are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells:

- B-Raf
- BRAF
- BRAFV600E
- BRAFnon-V600E
- IDH1/2
- IDH1
- IDH2
- ATRX
- TP53
- CDKN2A
- CDKN2B

These antigens are mentioned in the context of immunotherapy and tumor targeting, with the following information on their expression levels across different cancer types:

- B-Raf is a serine-threonine kinase in the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which transduces mitogenic stimuli after the activation by growth factor receptors that are involved in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. MAPK pathway activation is common in various neoplasms, and active RAS mutations have been detected in approximately 15% of malignant human tumors.
- Compared with ARAF and RAF1, BRAF plays a critical role in kinase activity. A previous study showed that RAF1 is activated by BRAF through direct interactions between proteins and phosphorylation. BRAF participates in the pathological mechanism of 7% of human neoplasms, especially in patients with melanoma and colorectal, thyroid, and lung cancer. The expression of BRAF is highly restrained, and the high expression of BRAF in neural cells indicates that it is a vital MEK kinase in neuronal tissues. BRAF mutations are found in some central nervous system neoplasms. In pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs), these alterations correlate with oncogenic senescence, which may contribute to an improved prognosis. The BRAFV600E mutation is rare in adult LGGs and glioblastomas and can only be found in 1 to 5% of samples. While BRAF activation contributes to tumor development and progression in the neural stem cells and progenitor cells of Homo sapiens, BRAF mutations are detected in adult diffuse gliomas and are associated with poor outcomes.
- Most studies have focused on the BRAFV600E mutation, although more than 70 BRAF mutations have been reported to date. Mutations in BRAF at V600 can activate ERK, which plays a critical role in the G1/S transition by adjusting the expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, and p21Cip1. The BRAFV600E mutation is the most potent MAPK pathway activator, whereas BRAFnon-V600E mutations are low-activity kinases that slightly stimulate the MAPK pathway. However, these low-activity BRAF mutants could activate MAPK signaling in COS-1 cells to a high level by activating RAF1.
- Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a frequent mutation associated with a survival benefit in glioma patients and it has been defined as a molecular parameter to define the categories of brain tumors in the updated 2016 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS). IDH1 and BRAFV600E mutations are associated with infiltrative gliomas or circumscribed gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, respectively, and they are exclusive in most cases. The exact effect of BRAF non-V600E and BRAFV600E on the prognosis of glioma patients and whether there are unique molecular characteristics in their MAPK and p53 pathways remain largely unknown.
- In this study, co-occurring mutations and copy number alterations of 35 associated genes in the MAPK and p53 pathways were retrieved and investigated, and the prognosis of the available adult glioma cohorts with BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E were evaluated by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database. The authors determined that BRAFnon-V600E exhibited a stronger association with the IDH1/2 mutation than BRAFV600E, but no survival advantage was found.
- The study populations were divided into two groups, BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E. The major demographic characteristics and clinical data of the two groups are summarized in Table 2. The patients’ ages ranged from 20 to 85 years and were divided into early adulthood, midlife, mature adulthood, and late adulthood (aged 20–35, 35–50, 50–80, and >80 years, respectively). The two groups had comparable proportions of male patients, diagnosis age, cancer type, and overall survival status. Glioblastoma multiform was the most common cancer type in both cohorts (74.07% vs. 56.00%; P=0.175; Table 2).
- The mutation frequencies of KRAS, HRAS, RAF1, MAP 3K1, MAP 2K1, MAP 2K2, MAP 2K4, MDM2, MDM4, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B were comparable between the two groups. In contrast, the BRAFnon-V600E group exhibited a significantly higher mutation frequency of TP53 (56.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.001), IDH1/2 (36.00% vs. 3.70%; P=0.015), and ATRX (32.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.037) than the BRAFV600E group. The variables with P<0.10 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the BRAFnon-V600E group exhibited a significantly higher TP53 mutation frequency (56.00% vs. 7.41%; P=0.031) than the BRAFV600E group (Table 3).
- There were no available copy number data for five patients with BRAFV600E and five patients with BRAFnon-V600E. The copy number alterations of the available co-occurring genes included BRAF, RAF1, MAP 3K1, MAP 2K1, MAP 2K2, MAP 2K4, MAPK1, MAPK3, TP53, MDM2, MDM4, TP53BP1, IDH1, IDH2, ATRX, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B. The HD copy number was frequently retrieved for these two genes, including CDKN2A and CDKN2B (Fig. 2), and the HD of both CDKN2A (77.27.00% vs. 60.00%; P=0.032) and CDKN2B (77.27.00% vs. 60.00%; P=0.032) was more frequent in the BRAFV600E cohort than in the BRAFnon-V600E cohort (Table 4).
- The estimated mean survival time was 51.394 months for patients with BRAFV600E, 89.958 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E, 44.500 months for patients with BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT, and 93.821 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT. There was no difference between the survival of BRAFV600E and BRAFnon-V600E (51.394 vs. 89.958, chi-square 1.130, P=0.288). In addition, there was no difference between the survival of BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT and BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT (44.500 vs. 93.821, chi-square 0.007, P=0.935), which excluded the survival benefit of IDH1/2. The authors also evaluated the survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop and activation segment. The estimated survival time of these two subgroups was 12.250 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop and 34.800 months for patients with BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the activation segment. In addition, there was no difference between the BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT cohorts and those of the BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT cohorts. As shown below, BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT vs. BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT had mutations in the G-loop (44.500 vs. 12.250, chi-squared 0.122, P=0.727), and BRAFV600E & IDH1/2WT vs. BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT had mutations in the activation segment (44.500 vs. 34.800, chi-square 0.145, P=0.703). Since the estimated mean survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop was the shortest, the authors compared the BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop with the remaining BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT patients. There was no difference between them (12.250 vs. 95.100, chi-square 0.008, P=0.927) (Fig. 3). The numbers at risk of Kaplan–Meier survival curves were shown in Supplementary Dataset S2.
- The authors propose that a larger sample is necessary for confirmation of this finding. Their data indicated that the BRAFnon-V600E cohort had no survival advantage from co-occurrence with IDH mutations compared with the BRAFnon-V600E cohort of adult patients with glioma.
- The authors conclude that in adult patients with gliomas, BRAFnon-V600E, rather than BRAFV600E, frequently co-occurs with TP53, IDH1/2, and ATRX mutations. Both BRAFnon-V600E and BRAFV600E frequently overlapped with CDKN2A/2B HDs, whereas there were no significant differences between the two cohorts. Although there were significant differences in co-occurring gene mutations and copy number alterations, no difference was found in survival between cohorts of BRAFnon-V600E and BRAFV600E with and without IDH1/2 favorable effects on survival. They also found that the estimated mean survival of BRAFnon-V600E & IDH1/2WT with mutations in the G-loop was the shortest; however, no difference was observed between that cohort and other cohorts. Due to the poor available mRNA and protein data in the TCGA database they retrieved in this study, no expression data were evaluated. More clinical data or models are necessary to elucidate the mechanism involved in BRAFnon-V600E-associated glioma in the future.
I'm sorry, I could not find any information about antigens with strong expression on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells in the provided text.
- MARCO: MARCO is a scavenger receptor normally found on alveolar macrophages with a variety of immunomodulatory roles. It is highly expressed on a subpopulation of macrophages in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but not in IDH-mutant GBM or lower-grade gliomas. MARCO expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes and the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. The mesenchymal nature of MARCO is supported by its role in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition outside the context of cancer. MARCO+ macrophages demonstrate loss of inflammatory pathways and antigen presentation, and are recruited from the blood via the upregulation of a set of factors secreted by tumor cells, including CSF1 and TGF-β. Anti-MARCO therapeutic antibodies have demonstrated efficacy in mouse melanoma models, and MARCO expression changes in the course of anti-PD1 immunotherapy, with responders exhibiting decreases in MARCO in the long term following treatment.
- CSF1: CSF1 is a macrophage colony-stimulating factor that is upregulated in tumor cells and is associated with higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. CSF1 expression in tumor cells has been previously shown to be related to higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. CSF1R inhibitors are a potential therapeutic option for targeting TAMs.
- TGF-β: TGF-β is a growth factor that is upregulated in tumor cells and is associated with higher proportions of TAMs in GBM. TGF-β has been experimentally shown to upregulate MARCO expression in M0 BMDMs, joining a host of other studies implicating TGF-β in glioma progression.

These antigens are highly expressed on IDH-wildtype glioblastoma cancer cells and are associated with poor clinical outcomes and the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. They are also involved in the recruitment of macrophages from the blood and have been targeted in immunotherapy and tumor-targeting strategies.
- Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)
- FAP is a member of the dipeptidyl peptidase family, which has catalytic activity and is engaged in protein recruitment and scaffolds.
- Recent studies have found that FAP expression in different types of cells within the GBM microenvironment is typically upregulated compared with that in lower grade glioma and is most pronounced in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM.
- As a marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with tumorigenic activity, FAP has been proven to promote tumor growth and invasion via hydrolysis of molecules such as brevican in the extracellular matrix and targeting of downstream pathways and substrates, such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21).
- In addition, based on its ability to suppress antitumor immunity in GBM and induce temozolomide resistance, FAP may be a potential target for immunotherapy and reversing temozolomide resistance; however, current studies on therapies targeting FAP are still limited.
- In this review, the authors summarized recent progress in FAP expression profiling and the understanding of the biological function of FAP in GBM and raised the possibility of FAP as an imaging biomarker and therapeutic target.
- They found that FAP is expressed in various cell types within the GBM microenvironment, including GBM cells, stromal mesenchymal cells, pericytes, and GBM-derived endothelial cells.
- FAP plays a protumorigenic role in GBM and other solid tumors, and its enzymatic and nonenzymatic activity has been investigated in other solid tumors, suggesting possible exploration directions for FAP in GBM.
- Several substrates of FAP have been identified, including collagen I and III, FGFR21, and NPY, and the functional roles of FAP enzymatic activity have also been investigated.
- Via enzymatic cleavage of its substrates, FAP plays an important role in extracellular matrix modulation, infiltrated macrophage education, metabolic regulation, and tumor promotion; therefore, inhibiting the enzymatic activity of FAP may be a potential strategy of antitumor therapy.
- In GBM, several of the mentioned substrates were investigated, and possible functional roles of FAP in GBM were also proposed.
- The authors discussed the current knowledge of FAP roles in GBM, including tumor proliferation and invasion, angiogenesis, immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, EMT, and TMZ resistance.
- They also explored the future clinical applications of FAP, including FAP as a potential imaging biomarker, prognostic value of FAP, and advances in FAP-targeted therapy.
- The authors concluded that current studies have discovered upregulated FAP expression in GBM and proposed potential roles of FAP in GBM which are not yet well characterized in GBM; however, preclinical studies have shown the potential of FAP in clinical practice, while more investigation is needed to fulfill our understanding of FAP functional roles and overcome the challenges we are facing to improve FAP targeted therapy in GBM.
